Negative Phototaxis 
While many organisms need light to survive, certain animals that live in dark environments 
need to avoid light because it threatens their survival. When exposed to light from the Sun or 
another source, these animals move away from the light, seeking darkness. This movement 
pattern is called negative phototaxis. Negative phototaxis allows animals to avoid the 
dangerous effects of being exposed to light. In order to be able to move away from light, 
these animals often have special physical features that allow them to sense the presence of 
light, since they live in the dark and may not have fully developed vision.
