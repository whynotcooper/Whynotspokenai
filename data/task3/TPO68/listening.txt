Now listen to part of a lecture in a biology class Okay so as an example, let's look at earthworms as their name suggests, of course earthworms spend most of their time living underground and this underground environment is dark and moist which is perfect for earthworms they need to keep their skin moist because they absorb oxygen from the surrounding soil through the surface of their skin they actually breathe through their skin so if an earthworm ended up above ground exposed to the sunlight, if it needs to escape, get out the sunlight since the rays of the sun would eventually cause its skin to dry out and with dry skin the worm wouldn't be able to breathe, it would die but the thing is earthworms don't have eyes they aren't able to see things the way many other animals can but when they're digging tunnels through the earth, they know if they've accidentally dug a tunnel to the surface because they have special cells on the outsides of their bodies that are sensitive to sunlight so if a worm digs a tunnel that leads toward the open air and sunlight, these cells detect the light and the worm reacts by turning around and going the other way tunneling deeper underground until it cells no longer detect sunlight This way the worm manages to stay underground where its skin can stay moist.
