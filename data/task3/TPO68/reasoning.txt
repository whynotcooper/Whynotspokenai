I will first define "negative phototaxis" as the instinctive movement away from light to avoid danger, particularly for organisms adapted to dark environments. Then, I will connect this directly to the earthworm example by explaining how earthworms' underground lifestyle makes sunlight dangerous (drying their skin and preventing respiration), and how their light-sensitive cells trigger retreat behavior when detecting light. This clearly illustrates the concept by showing both the "movement away from light" and the "survival benefit" aspects mentioned in the reading. The response will explicitly follow the instruction to "explain how the example illustrates the concept" by highlighting the cause (light detection) and effect (movement into darkness).
