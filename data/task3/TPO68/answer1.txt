Negative phototaxis is an organism's movement away from a light source to ensure its survival. The earthworm is a perfect illustration of this concept. Since it breathes through its skin, it must remain in a moist, dark environment. Sunlight is a direct threat because it dries the worm's skin, preventing respiration and leading to death. Although earthworms lack eyes, they possess specialized light-sensitive cells on their bodies. If, while tunneling, these cells detect sunlight, the worm immediately turns around and moves deeper underground, away from the light. This instinctive retreat into darkness is a direct behavioral example of negative phototaxis, allowing the earthworm to avoid a lethal environment and remain safely in the soil.
