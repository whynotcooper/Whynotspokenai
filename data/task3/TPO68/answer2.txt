The term negative phototaxis describes a behavior where creatures instinctively move away from light to avoid peril. This is clearly demonstrated by the earthworm. Living underground, the worm relies on a moist environment to breathe through its skin. Exposure to sunlight is hazardous, as it causes dehydration and suffocation. To counter this, earthworms are equipped with unique cells that detect light, even without proper vision. When these cells sense light during tunneling, the worm's reaction is to reverse its direction and burrow further down into the soil. This action of seeking darkness upon light detection is a classic case of negative phototaxis, enabling the worm to evade a life-threatening situation.
