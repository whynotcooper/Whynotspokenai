Brand revival is a marketing strategy where companies reintroduce discontinued products, combining their original, popular features with modern updates to appeal to today's consumers. The professor’s lecture illustrates this with the example of a small car. This vehicle was originally popular for its sporty look and compact size but was eventually phased out. Years later, the company revived it, retaining the attractive, nostalgic design that made it iconic. However, they updated the engine to be more fuel-efficient, addressing current consumer preferences for economical cars. This blend of retro style and modern functionality made the revived car successful, especially in cities where its size and efficiency are valued.
