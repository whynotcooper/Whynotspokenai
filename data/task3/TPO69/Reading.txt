Brand Revival 
Sometimes consumers begin to feel nostalgic about certain products from long ago. People 
become attracted to the products' old-fashioned or retro features. In a strategy called brand 
revival, companies decide to revive and market products that were discontinued years earlier. 
Brand revival usually involves redesigning products, with a combination of the old features 
that made them popular, and updated features that are more relevant and meet the 
standards of consumers today.
