Now, listen to part of a lecture in a business class. So here's an example of how this actually worked in the United States and Europe Now youre a little too young to remember this brand, but many years ago a car company became really popular because of these very small cars. these vehicles were cute and really sporty, In fact, lots of people drove them After a number of years, however, car styles changed and cars became larger. Eventually the company stopped making the small cars. Well, about 10 years ago, the company decided to produce this type of car again. The company thought that the sporty look and its small size would be attractive to lots of people today, especially people living in cities See this car drives through crowded city streets easily and can be parked in pretty tight spaces but the little cars from the past also used a lot of gasoline Nowadays most consumers prefer cars with engines that are fuel efficient right so the company recognized this trend and redesigned the cars to have more efficient engines the cars have the same cute sporty look, but this version uses less fuel and in fact, theyve become really popular with today's model selling quite well..
