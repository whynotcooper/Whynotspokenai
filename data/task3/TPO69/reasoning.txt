I will first define "brand revival" as the strategy of reintroducing discontinued products by blending nostalgic, retro features with modern updates to meet current consumer standards. The lecture example of the small car revival perfectly illustrates this: the company brought back the car's iconic sporty look and small size (nostalgic features) but updated the engine for better fuel efficiency (modern relevance). My response will explicitly connect these elements, showing how the example demonstrates the concept by highlighting the balance between retro appeal and contemporary improvements that led to commercial success.
