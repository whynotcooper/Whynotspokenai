I will first define the "illusion of transparency" as the false belief that our internal feelings are obvious to others, even when we try to conceal them, due to our heightened self-awareness. Then, I will connect this directly to the professor's dinner party example, showing how his intense focus on his own dislike of the garlic made him assume his host could detect his displeasure, when in reality, she was completely unaware. The response will explicitly follow the task by explaining how the example demonstrates the concept, highlighting the mismatch between the professor's internal certainty and the external reality.
