illusion of Transparency
 When we experience strong emotions, we often believe, falsely, that other people
 can detect those emotions, even if we try to hide them. This false belief, that others
 can “see through us” and know even our innermost feelings that we try to hide, is
 called the illusion of transparency. Why are we susceptible to such an illusion? Why
 do wesometimes believe that our feelings are more obvious to others than they
 really are? Research suggests that the reason is this: when our emotions are very
 strong, we focus on them very intently and are extremely aware of them. This
 heightened awareness of our own feelings causes us to assume that they must be
 obvious to others as well.
