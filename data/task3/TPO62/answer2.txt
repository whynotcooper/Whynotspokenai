Illusion of transparency refers to the false conviction that our concealed internal states are visible to others. This concept is demonstrated by the professor’s anecdote. He was served a dish with garlic, which he detests, and while he attempted to act normally, his own acute awareness of his dislike led him to conclude that his host, Mary, must have detected his true feelings. Yet, later evidence from Mary herself confirmed she was entirely unaware of his displeasure. The discrepancy between his certainty of being "seen through" and the actual lack of observation from others is a classic example of this psychological illusion.
