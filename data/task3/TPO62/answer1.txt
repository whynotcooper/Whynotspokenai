The illusion of transparency is the mistaken belief that our hidden emotions are easily perceived by others. The professor’s experience perfectly illustrates this. At the dinner party, he strongly disliked the garlic in the meal but tried to hide his feelings to avoid offending his host, Mary. Because he was so intensely aware of his own distaste, he assumed his discomfort was obvious to her. However, his conversation the next day revealed that Mary had not noticed anything was wrong; she even commented on how much everyone enjoyed the food. This shows his internal feelings were not as transparent as he believed, clearly demonstrating the illusion.
