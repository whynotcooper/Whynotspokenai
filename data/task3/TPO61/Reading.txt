Diffusion Effect in Health Studies
 Whenhealth education experts want to test the effectiveness of a program designed
 to improve a particular health condition, they often do a study with two groups of
 people. One group participates in the program, while the other does not： and the
 researchers compare the two groups to see if the program was effective in
 improving health. However, if the groups come into contact during the study, a
 diffusion effect may occur Members of the group participating in the program may
 mistakenly share information about it with members of the other group This often
 leads to the results of the study being useless
