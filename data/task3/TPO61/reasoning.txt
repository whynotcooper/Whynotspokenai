I will first define the "diffusion effect" from the reading as a situation in a two-group study where information unintentionally spreads from the treatment group to the control group, compromising the study's validity. Then, I will connect this directly to the lecture's example by explaining how office workers from Group A discussed their beneficial exercises within earshot of Group B, who then adopted them. This clearly illustrates the diffusion effect because the accidental sharing of information led to both groups performing the intervention, making it impossible to determine the program's true effectiveness, thereby rendering the study's results useless, just as the concept describes. My responses will explicitly follow the task by explaining this relationship and will be structured to fit within the word and time constraints, using varied phrasing while staying accurate.
