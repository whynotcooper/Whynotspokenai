Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a psychology class so okay let's look at an example, a researcher wanted to study ways to prevent office workers from getting stiff and tired sitting all day at their desks so he came up with a simple program of exercises, special stretches and things and he wanted to know if this exercise program would keep people from getting so tired during the workday so he did a study he divided the workers in an office building into two groups, group A and group B the researcher had group A do this new exercise program, these special exercises and stretches every day while group B they were told just to work as usual and group A was told not to tell group B about the exercises they were doing the study went on for a couple weeks and what happened was one day some people from group A were talking about how the exercises they were doing were making them feel great that they weren't becoming so stiff and tired during the workday and some people from group B were sitting nearby and overheard them and so these people in group B decided to start doing the exercises too so of course the researcher wasn't able to tell how well the exercises actually worked because people from both groups were doing themExplain how the example from the lecture illustrates the concept of the diffusion effect.
