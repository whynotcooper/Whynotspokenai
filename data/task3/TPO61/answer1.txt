The diffusion effect occurs in health studies when members of a group receiving a treatment accidentally
 share information with a control group, making the study's results invalid. In the lecture, this is illustrated 
 by a study on office exercises. Researchers had Group A perform daily stretches to reduce stiffness, while Group 
 B continued working normally. Group A was instructed not to discuss the program. However, some Group A members were
  overheard talking about the exercises' benefits by Group B workers, who then started doing them too. Consequently, 
  since both groups ended up performing the exercises, the researcher couldn't determine if the program was truly effective,
   demonstrating how unintended information sharing ruins the study's comparison, exactly as the diffusion effect describes.
