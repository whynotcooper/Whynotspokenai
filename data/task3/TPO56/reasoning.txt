I will first define "task partitioning" as the division of labor into distinct, sequential stages performed by specialized groups, which increases efficiency. The lecture example of leaf-cutter ants directly illustrates this: the ants are divided into three groups—one cuts leaves and drops them, a second cuts them smaller at the base, and a third transports them partway to the nest—each group performing a fixed stage. This demonstrates the concept by showing how specialization saves time and energy, as no ant climbs the entire tree repeatedly, aligning with the reading's emphasis on ordered stages and efficiency gains.
