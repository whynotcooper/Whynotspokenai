Compound nesting is when two distinct insect species cohabit closely without competing for resources, gaining mutual survival benefits. The professor’s example perfectly illustrates this. Two ant species in Africa—one large, one small—share a hollow tree branch. The larger ants gather food, leaving behind tiny scraps as waste. The smaller ants consume these leftovers, so they avoid competing for the same food source. This arrangement benefits both: the small ants get nourishment without foraging, while their cleaning of scraps prevents harmful bacterial growth, protecting the larger ants from disease. Thus, their coexistence provides specific advantages to each group, enhancing both species’ chances of survival.
