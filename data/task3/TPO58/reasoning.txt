I will first define "compound nesting" from the reading as two different insect species living closely together without competing for resources, providing mutual survival advantages. Then, I will connect this directly to the lecture's example of the two African ant species sharing a hollow tree branch. The explanation will highlight how their size difference prevents competition (large ants collect food, small ants eat scraps), while emphasizing the reciprocal benefits: small ants get easy food access, and large ants enjoy a cleaner nest free from disease-causing bacteria. This clearly illustrates the concept's core idea of non-competitive cohabitation with mutual gains.
