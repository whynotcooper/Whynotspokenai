 Compound Nesting
 Sometimes two different species of insects live close together, side by
 side. The two insect groups might even share the same home. But the
 two species often are different enough that they do not have to compete
 for the same resources, and therefore they can avoid conflict. This is
 known as compound nesting. Compound nesting actually provides
 advantages to both species: because living closely together can result in
 a specific benefit to each group, benefits that increase both species‘chancesofsurvival
