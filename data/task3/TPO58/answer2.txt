The concept of compound nesting describes two insect species living side-by-side in a way that avoids resource competition, yielding advantages for both. In the lecture, this is demonstrated by two ant types in Africa inhabiting the same hollow tree. The bigger ants collect food, and the smaller ants feed on the waste scraps left behind, eliminating direct competition. This symbiotic relationship offers clear benefits: the small ants obtain food effortlessly, and by consuming leftovers, they maintain cleanliness, which reduces bacteria that could harm the larger ants. Therefore, the example shows how compound nesting allows different species to coexist profitably, with each gaining a survival edge.
