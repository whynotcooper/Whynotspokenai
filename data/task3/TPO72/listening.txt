Nowll listen to part of a lecture in the psychology class Okay well so recently when I was buying a new car, I was looking at several different cars and I took a lot of time researching the advantages and disadvantages of each one before finally making up my mind to buy one particular car However it was a different matter yesterday when I had to go to the store to buy some batteries for a flashlight and there must have been at least four or five different brands of batteries at the store batteries made by different companies well no doubt some batteries may last longer than others and some might be higher in quality or cost slightly more or slightly less but do you think I stood there reading each batteries package or do you think I asked the salespeople questions so I could compare them Of course not because frankly they all cost around the same and they probably last about the same amount of time and well, I didn't want to waste 10 minutes standing there trying to figure out which batteries were best I just grabbed the first ones I saw and ba for them.
