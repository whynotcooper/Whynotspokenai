The concept of rational ignorance describes a situation where individuals intentionally avoid seeking out information because the cost in time or energy outweighs any minor advantage gained from a more informed decision. This is effectively illustrated by the professor's personal anecdote. He contrasts his extensive research for a significant car purchase with his quick decision when buying batteries. Despite the availability of several brands with potential minor differences in quality and price, he consciously chose not to investigate any of them. He reasoned that the small potential benefit wasn't worth even ten minutes of his time, so he purchased the first batteries he saw, thus acting in a state of rational ignorance.
