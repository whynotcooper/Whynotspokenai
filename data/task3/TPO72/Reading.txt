 Rational ignorance
 When people are planning to make an important purchase, they often spend a
 great deal of time gathering information about their various options to make
 the best possible choice. However, when making less important purchases,
 people may decide that it is not worth gathering information beforehand. This
 phenomenon is called rational ignorance. If the differences between products
 seem small or unimportant, people may decide not to learn about them. In
 other words, people deliberately choose to remain ignorant of the differences
 because learning about them is not worth the time or energy. The products
 are so similar that no significant benefit can come from choosing one over
 another.
