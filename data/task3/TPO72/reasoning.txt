I will first define "rational ignorance" as the deliberate choice to avoid gathering information when the perceived benefit of doing so is outweighed by the time or effort required, particularly for minor decisions. The lecture example perfectly illustrates this: the professor meticulously researched a major purchase (a car) but deliberately avoided comparing batteries, a trivial purchase. My response will explicitly connect these two parts by stating the definition, then describing the battery example, and finally explaining that the professor’s behavior—ignoring minor product differences to save time—is a direct demonstration of rational ignorance. The key is to show that the battery purchase was not worth the effort of information gathering, which is the core of the concept.
