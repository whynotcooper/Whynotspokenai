Rational ignorance is the idea that people deliberately choose not to gather information when the effort isn't justified by the potential benefit of making a slightly better choice. The professor's lecture provides a clear example of this. When he bought a car, a major purchase, he spent considerable time researching his options. However, when he needed batteries, a small, inexpensive item, he saw multiple brands but didn't compare them. He knew some might last longer or cost slightly different amounts, but he decided it wasn't worth his time to read packages or ask questions. Since the batteries were similar in price and performance, he simply grabbed the first one, demonstrating rational ignorance by choosing to remain uninformed to avoid an unnecessary effort.
