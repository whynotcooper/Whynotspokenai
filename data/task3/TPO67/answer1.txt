The concept of a nomadic phase describes a period when a group of insects travels continuously to find temporary resources that are unavailable near their nest, settling again once that need is met. The professor’s lecture perfectly illustrates this with a specific type of ant. When a colony has many baby ants that require a large amount of nutrition, the nearby food supply is insufficient. This temporary need forces the entire colony, carrying the young, to enter a nomadic phase. They move to a new location each night to access a fresh food supply. This continual travel persists only until the baby ants grow and their high nutritional demands decrease. Once this need is over, the nomadic phase ends, and the ants settle to build a new, permanent nest.
