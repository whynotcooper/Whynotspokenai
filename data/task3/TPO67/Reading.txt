Nomadic Phase 
Certain insects spend time in both extended periods of settlement and extended periods of 
travel. During a period of travel, the entire group will continually move from one place to 
another. This is known as a nomadic phase. A nomadic phase may begin because a group of 
insects has a temporary need for additional resources that cannot be found in the area near 
the nest. Thus, the group must travel in search of these resources. Once the need for 
additional resources is over the nomadic phase ends and the group settles again in one 
location.
