Now listen to part of a lecture in a biology class okay so the behavior of a particular kind of ant is a good example of this. These ants live together in colonies or ant communities underground they have these underground nests in the forest and much of their life is made up of collecting food, finding food near the nest and bring it back to the colony Now when there are baby ants in the colony, there isn't enough food in that one location baby ants require a lot of nutrition, more food than can be found by just searching around near the underground nest so the colony needs to do something about this to make sure the baby ants have enough food to grow so what they'll do is pretty dramatic the entire colony will leave the nest they'll pick up the baby ants and carry them along to a new location to find a new food supply and once that food supply runs out, they'll move again to another location to ensure they have a continual fresh food supply often moving every night to meet the demanding nutritional needs of the baby ants and this goes on until eventually the baby ants grow and no longer need so much food when this happens, the community ants can finally stop moving from place to place and find a spot in the forest to make a new underground nest for the group to stay in and live.
