A nomadic phase is an extended period of travel undertaken by insects to secure additional resources that are temporarily scarce near their home base, concluding when the requirement is fulfilled. This is clearly demonstrated in the lecture's example of a certain ant colony. The arrival of baby ants creates a temporary but urgent need for more food than the local area can provide. Consequently, the colony abandons its nest and embarks on a nomadic phase, relocating every single night to find new food sources for the developing young. This behavior continues exclusively during the period of high demand. Finally, when the baby ants mature and no longer need such intensive feeding, the nomadic phase ceases, and the colony establishes a new, settled nest.
