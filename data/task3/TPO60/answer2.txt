The concept of deceptive caching involves animals hiding food deceptively to deter thieves by leading them to false locations. This is clearly demonstrated by the Eastern gray squirrels described in the lecture. While storing nuts for winter, they excavate many holes but deposit nuts in only some. In others, they place non-food items like twigs, yet meticulously conceal every hole as if it contained treasure. This tricks observing blue jays into investigating numerous barren sites. Repeated unsuccessful searches cause the birds to become discouraged and abandon their theft efforts, exactly as the reading explains. Therefore, the squirrels’ tactic of creating convincing decoys directly exemplifies deceptive caching, effectively protecting their actual reserves.
