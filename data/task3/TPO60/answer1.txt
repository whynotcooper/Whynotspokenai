Deceptive caching is a strategy where animals protect stored food by creating fake hiding places to mislead potential thieves. The professor’s example of Eastern gray squirrels perfectly illustrates this. When gathering nuts, these squirrels dig numerous holes. If a blue jay is nearby, they only bury nuts in a few holes, placing twigs or stones in the rest. Crucially, they cover all holes identically with leaves and dirt, making empty ones appear genuine. This deceives the blue jay into searching multiple fake caches. Since most attempts yield no nuts, the bird wastes energy and becomes frustrated. Eventually, it gives up, just as the concept predicts. Thus, the squirrels successfully safeguard their real food supply through this deceptive behavior.
