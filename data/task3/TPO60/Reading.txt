Deceptive Caching
 When food is plentiful, animals often collect and hide extra food to eat when it is
 scarce. However, other animals may try to steal this stored food: and eat it
 themselves. To protect their food supply, some animals engage in deceptive caching.
 Using this technique: animals deceive other animals into thinking that food is hidden
 in one place： while it is actually hidden somewhere else. Deceptive caching tricks
 animals that try to steal food, making it harder for them to find the food supply. If
 their attempts at stealing food are repeatedly unsuccessful, the animals often
 becomediscouraged and stop trying to steal hidden food.
