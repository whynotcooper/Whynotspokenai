I will first define the academic concept of "deceptive caching" from the reading, which involves animals hiding food in misleading ways to protect it from thieves. The core elements are: 1) creating false hiding spots, 2) deceiving potential thieves, and 3) discouraging future theft attempts through repeated failure. I will then connect this directly to the lecture's example of Eastern gray squirrels, explicitly showing how their behavior—digging multiple holes but only putting nuts in a few while carefully covering all holes—demonstrates each aspect of deceptive caching. The response will highlight how the squirrels' actions mislead blue jays, waste the birds' energy on empty holes, and ultimately cause them to give up, perfectly illustrating the concept's mechanism and purpose as described in the reading.
