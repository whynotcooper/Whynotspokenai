Now listen to part of a lecture in a biology class Okay so here's a good example of thisRecently a team of researchers was observing a certain type of squirrel, Eastern gray squirrels gathering nuts for the winter and of course gray squirrels try to gather enough nuts so that they'll have food to eat all winter long, and they dig holes in the ground and bury the ahorns there, but here's what's interesting, the gray squirrels don't always put nuts in all of the holes they dig, if there's another animal nearby that might want eat the nuts, say a bird like a blue ja, the squirrel might dig a whole bunch of holes but instead of putting nuts in all of them, the squirrel will just drop a twig or a stone in most of the holes and only put nuts in a few but even though there aren't any nuts in some of the holes, the squirrel will still go through the same process of covering these holes up with leaves and dirt as though they actually had nuts in them so then a blue ja might find these holes and start digging in them but since most of the holes only have a twig or a stone inside the blue Jay wouldn't find a lot of nuts so after a while itd lose interest in give up lookingExplain how the example of the Eastern gray squirrel illustrates the concept of deceptive caching.
