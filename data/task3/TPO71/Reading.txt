Masking
 The impact of environmental noise is a serious concern to scientists because the
 presence of excessive noise in an animal's environment can threaten its survival.
 Animals regularly produce and receive sounds in their daily lives for a variety of
 purposes, such as communication or the search for food. When environmental
 sounds are louder than sounds that the animal uses, the result is known as masking.
 Masking is a covering over of one sound with another sound Scientists believe that
 masking impedes animals' ability to transmit or receive biologically important signals
 that are essential for survival.
