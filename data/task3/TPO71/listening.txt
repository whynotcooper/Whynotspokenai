Now, listen to part of a lecture in a biology class Well a good example of this is shown in a scientific study involving whales orca whales which happen to be one of the largest whale species Now orcas have a very sharp sense of hearing that is absolutely vital to their existence In fact they make special sounds and listen to the sounds echoes to help them determine the location shape and size of objects in their habitat like food In other words, an orca whale uses an echo system to gather information about its immediate surroundings it makes a series of clicking sounds and the echoes from these clicking sounds helped lead the whale to the location of its next meal Now in their research scientists studied noises in an orca whale habitat off the west coast of Canada The scientists focused on noise from boats using the same waterway as the whales These researchers wanted to learn about possible changes in the whale's behavior when the noise level from the boats increased In the end, an increase in the level of environmental noise from the boats is believed to have blocked the transmission distance of the whale's clicking sounds scientists notice that the size of the area in which the whale searched for food became smaller by up to 20 percent So it appears that the whale's ecosystem were not able to function fully Basically the whales couldn't gather as much information about possible sources of food in their surroundings Explain the concept of masking and how it affects orca whales begin to prepare your response after the beep.
