The term masking refers to a situation in which ambient noise becomes louder than the critical sounds an animal produces, thereby covering those signals and obstructing the creature's capacity to send or receive vital information. In the lecture, orca whales exemplify this problem. These whales depend on sharp hearing and echolocation clicks to detect and locate food. Researchers observed that when boat traffic increased in their habitat, the resulting noise masked the whales' clicks. This interference shortened the functional distance of their echolocation, causing the whales' foraging area to decrease by as much as twenty percent. Thus, masking hindered the orcas' hunting efficiency, showing a direct threat to their survival.
