Masking is an ecological concept where loud environmental sounds cover or interfere with biologically important signals animals use for survival, hindering their ability to communicate or find food. This is clearly illustrated with orca whales. Orcas rely on echolocation, producing clicks and listening for echoes to locate prey. However, a study off Canada showed that noise from boats in their habitat masked these clicking sounds. The boat noise blocked the transmission of the whales' signals, reducing the effective range of their echolocation. As a result, the area where orcas could search for food shrunk by up to twenty percent, demonstrating how masking directly impairs their ability to gather essential information and survive.
