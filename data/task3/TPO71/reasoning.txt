I will first define "masking" as the concept where environmental noise covers or interferes with biologically important sounds, impeding an animal's ability to transmit or receive essential signals. Then, I will connect this directly to the lecture's example of orca whales, explaining how boat noise masks their echolocation clicks, reducing their effective foraging range. The response will explicitly show how the example illustrates the concept by detailing the cause (boat noise) and effect (reduced food-search area), ensuring it aligns with the task of explaining both the concept and its specific impact on orcas.
