Exaptation
 The physical features of an animal's body usually serve a specific purpose
they function to increase the animal's chances of survival. But over time in
 response to a particular challenge in its environment an animal species will
 sometim es use one of its existing features for a new purpose. This is known
 as exaptation. By finding another use for one of its physical features
 exaptation allows animals to respond to additional challenges in their
 environm ent. The animal may continue to use the physical feature for its
 older purpose while also using it for the new purpose.
