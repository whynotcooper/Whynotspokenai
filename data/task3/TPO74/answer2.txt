Exaptation is defined as the adaptation of an existing biological feature for a novel purpose, all while preserving its initial function, to address additional environmental pressures. In the lecture, the heron demonstrates this concept through its wing usage. While wings primarily serve for flight, the heron has innovatively employed them as a shading tool. By positioning its wings overhead, it forms a canopy that minimizes glare on the water, improving its ability to spot fish during the day. This secondary use tackles the challenge of poor visibility, yet the wings remain fully functional for flying. Therefore, the heron’s behavior is a clear case of exaptation, showcasing how species creatively utilize traits to survive in changing conditions.
