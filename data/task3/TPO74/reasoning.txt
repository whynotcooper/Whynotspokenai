I will first define "exaptation" as the process where an animal uses an existing physical feature for a new purpose, while still retaining its original function, to meet an environmental challenge. Then, I will connect this directly to the heron example by explaining how the heron’s wings, originally for flight, are now also used to create shade to reduce glare and improve fish-spotting. This clearly illustrates the concept because the wings serve a dual purpose—flying (original) and shading (new)—demonstrating how exaptation helps animals adapt to additional challenges, as per the question’s instructions.
