Exaptation occurs when an animal repurposes an existing physical trait for a new function while maintaining its original use, helping it overcome environmental challenges. The heron example perfectly illustrates this. Originally, the heron’s wings evolved for flight, their primary purpose. However, due to difficulty seeing fish in water with sun glare, the heron began using its wings to create shade. By holding them above its head like an umbrella, it blocks sunlight, reduces reflections, and enhances visibility underwater. This new shading function allows the heron to hunt more effectively, yet it still uses its wings for flying. Thus, exaptation enables the heron to adapt to a visual challenge without sacrificing the wings’ original role.
