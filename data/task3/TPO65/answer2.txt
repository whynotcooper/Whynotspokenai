The concept of goal displacement describes a situation where adherence to organizational rules overshadows the original objective, making the organization less effective. In the lecture, the professor uses a school scenario to explain this. The fundamental goal is to educate students, and a policy requires punctuality to facilitate this. But when a teacher prioritizes this rule by excluding all latecomers from class, it backfires. Students missing class entirely due to lateness lose valuable learning opportunities. Thus, the strict enforcement of the procedure displaces the core aim of education, clearly showing how goal displacement undermines the organization's success.
