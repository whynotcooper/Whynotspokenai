I will first define "goal displacement" as the phenomenon where an organization's focus shifts from its primary goal to the rules and procedures meant to achieve it, ultimately hindering the goal's accomplishment. The lecture example perfectly illustrates this: the school's primary goal is student education, and the punctuality rule is a procedure to support that goal. However, the teacher's strict enforcement of the rule (barring late students from class) becomes the focus, directly preventing students from receiving education, thus displacing the actual goal. My response will explicitly connect the definition to the example, showing how the rule's enforcement interferes with the educational goal, as the question requires.
