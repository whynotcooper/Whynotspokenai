Okay, so schools are a good example of a place where this can happen we have schools of course, as a place for children to be educated and teachers are hired to actually educate the students right, their job is to ensure that the citizens of our society will have an education but in order for teachers to give children a good education, there are various requirements they need to impose like for instance coming to class on time, which is important right, for the learning process to go smoothly it's directly related to making sure kids get a good education but sometimes these requirements well they can actually work against students getting a good education like say in one school they have a policy that students must always show up to class on time and a teacher in that school to ensure that students show up on time, the teacher insists that if students arrive late, they aren't allowed in the classroom and no matter what the reason anytime a student shows up late, the teacher enforces this won't let them in the class well although the policy seems to be in the best interest of a child getting a good education because it's meant to ensure students get the most possible learning time well think about it if students do end up showing up late to class for whatever reason they'll have to miss the entire class which means they'll miss out on the opportunity to learn so in effect too much emphasis on the policy can get in the way of the child's education.
