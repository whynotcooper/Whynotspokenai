Goal displacement occurs when an organization's procedures, meant to support a primary goal, become the main focus and actually hinder achieving that goal. The professor illustrates this with a school example. The school's main goal is student education, and a punctuality rule exists to support learning by maximizing class time. However, a teacher strictly enforces this by not allowing any late students into class. This rigid focus on the rule means that students who are late, for any reason, miss the entire lesson. Consequently, the procedure intended to aid education directly prevents it, demonstrating goal displacement as the rule becomes more important than the educational objective itself.
