The question asks me to explain how the professor's experience illustrates the concept of "enclothed cognition." First, I must define enclothed cognition from the reading: it's the phenomenon where clothing, due to its specific meaning or association, can influence a person's cognitive processes and task performance, not just self-perception. However, the lecture example provided does not involve clothing at all; it describes the professor's worry about their dislike of garlic being obvious to others, which is actually an example of the "illusion of transparency" (the belief that one's internal states are more apparent to others than they really are). Since the task requires me to use the given materials strictly, I cannot invent a clothing-related example. Instead, I will note this discrepancy in the reasoning and proceed by accurately describing the provided example in the answers, as the instructions emphasize remaining faithful to the materials. In the answers, I will define enclothed cognition as per the reading and then explain that the lecture example does not illustrate it, as it lacks any clothing element and instead relates to a different psychological concept. This ensures the response directly addresses the task by clarifying the mismatch while adhering to the provided content.
