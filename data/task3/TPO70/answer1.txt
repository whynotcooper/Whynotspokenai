The concept of enclothed cognition refers to how wearing clothing with specific meanings can influence a person's cognitive abilities and task performance, beyond just self-perception. For instance, a lab coat associated with focus might improve attention. However, the professor's lecture example does not illustrate this concept, as it involves no clothing. Instead, the professor describes a dinner party where they disliked a garlic dish and feared their host noticed their discomfort, but later learned their feelings were not obvious. This demonstrates a different phenomenon, the illusion of transparency, where people overestimate how much others perceive their internal states. Since enclothed cognition requires clothing to trigger cognitive changes, and the example lacks this, it does not relate directly to the concept as defined.
