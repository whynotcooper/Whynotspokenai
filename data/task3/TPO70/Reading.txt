 Enclothed Cognition
 Researchers have known for some time that wearing a particular kind of clothing can
 affect how people perceive themselves. Recently, however, researchers have
 discovered that clothing may affect more than just how we feel about ourselves. The
 clothes people wear may also change their ability to process information and
 perform tasks, a phenomenon known as unclothed cognition. Certain clothing can
 have a particular meaning or association, and wearing this clothing may cause people
 to think and act in a waythat reflects this association.
