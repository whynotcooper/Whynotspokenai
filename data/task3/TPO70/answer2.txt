Enclothed cognition is a psychological phenomenon where attire with particular associations, such as a uniform symbolizing intelligence, can enhance cognitive processing and performance on tasks. In contrast, the professor's example from the lecture does not apply here, as it omits any reference to clothing. The professor recounts worrying that their dislike of a garlic-filled meal was apparent to the host, only to discover later that no one had noticed their true feelings. This situation highlights the illusion of transparency, not enclothed cognition, as it centers on misjudging the visibility of one's emotions without clothing influences. Thus, while the reading defines how clothing shapes cognition, the lecture example fails to connect, as it involves no enclothed elements to demonstrate the concept.
