 Role Distancing
 Throughout our lives, we take on many social roles, such as son or daughter, friend,
 and parent. Roles help us know how to behave and we are generally comfortable in
 them. Sometimes, however： people want to separate themselves from a role they
 are enacting: they want to show that this role does not represent who they really are.
 When people use their behavior to convey such detachment from a role, they are
 engaged in role distancing People often use gestures, facial expressions, and tone of
 voice to distance themselves from roles they are uncomfortable performing.
