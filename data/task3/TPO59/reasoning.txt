The question asks me to use the professor's example to explain the concept of "role distancing." First, I will define role distancing from the reading: it is when people use behavior to show they are detached from a social role they are performing, often because they are uncomfortable. The key is to demonstrate how the lecture example of the 13-year-old illustrates this. The teenager is enacting the role of "obedient child" but feels embarrassed in front of friends, so they use specific behaviors—like sighing, eye-rolling, a sarcastic tone, and dragging feet—to signal that this role doesn't represent their true, more mature self. My response must explicitly connect these behaviors to the concept, showing how they serve to distance the individual from the role.
