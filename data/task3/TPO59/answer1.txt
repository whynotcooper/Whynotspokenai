Role distancing is when individuals behave in ways that show they are detached from a social role they are currently performing, often because they feel uncomfortable with it. The professor’s example perfectly illustrates this. A 13-year-old is told by their mother to wash dishes in front of friends, forcing them into the "obedient child" role. However, the teen is embarrassed and wants to appear mature to their peers. To distance themselves from this childish role, they use clear behavioral cues: sighing heavily, rolling their eyes, using a sarcastic tone when saying "Yes, ma'am," and dragging their feet while walking to the kitchen. These actions communicate to everyone that they do not identify with the role, showing it is beneath their true, more independent self.
