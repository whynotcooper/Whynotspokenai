Now, listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a sociology class. Imagine this situation. You're 13 years old and you're hanging out with your friends at your house. Sudden your mother walks in and reminds you that you haven't done one of your chores. She tells you that you need to go into the kitchen and wash the dishes. Suddenly you're expected to be the obedient child, right, you should jump up and say, sure mom right away and go do it. but you're so embarrassed. you're afraid that if you act like a good kid now, your friends are going to think you're such a baby so uncool. you're thinking to yourself, come on, I am not a child. I shouldn't have my mommy telling me what to do especially not in front of my friends but you can't just refuse you have to wash those dishes so as you go to do it you make it clear to your friends that this whole thing is beneath you how maybe you sigh heavily and roll your eyes. you say Yes, ma'am, but in an insincere voice. maybe make a face when your mother turns her back. You move into the kitchen slowly dragging your feet the whole way and what you're doing is you're trying to tell everyone. including your mother, that you're way too old for this, that you're not really a little kidUse the example De by the professor to explain what roll distancing is..
