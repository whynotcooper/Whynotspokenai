The concept of role distancing refers to using specific behaviors to express detachment from a social role one is enacting, typically due to discomfort. This is demonstrated in the lecture where a teenager is put in the position of being an obedient child by their mother’s request to do chores in front of friends. Feeling embarrassed and wanting to seem cool, the teen employs role distancing through various gestures and tones. For instance, they roll their eyes, respond with an insincere "Yes, ma'am," make faces, and move slowly with dragged feet. These deliberate actions serve to signal that the role does not reflect their actual identity, thereby illustrating how people create separation from roles they find unsuitable.
