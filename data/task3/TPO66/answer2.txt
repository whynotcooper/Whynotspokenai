A commitment device refers to a pre-established arrangement designed to help individuals pursue their future goals by counteracting immediate desires that might derail them. The professor’s example demonstrates this: his aim was to prepare for a 10 km race, a long-term ambition, but he was tempted to sleep in rather than train. He implemented a commitment device by promising to meet a friend for morning runs. This social commitment made him accountable, compelling him to rise early and run, thus overcoming the urge to sleep. Consequently, he maintained his training regimen, enhanced his physical condition, and accomplished his race goal, clearly showing how such a device facilitates adherence to long-term plans.
