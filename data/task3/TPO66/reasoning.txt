I will first define the concept of a "commitment device" from the reading as a pre-made plan to help people stick to long-term goals when tempted by immediate desires. Then, I will connect this directly to the professor's lecture example, where his goal was to train for a 10 km race (long-term) but his immediate desire was to sleep in. The commitment device he used was arranging to meet a friend for morning runs, which created a social obligation that forced him to act in his long-term interest. My response will explicitly show how the example illustrates the concept by highlighting the conflict, the pre-arranged plan, and its success in aligning actions with the goal.
