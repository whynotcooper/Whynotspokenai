People often have certain goals they want to accomplish in the future. However, 
their immediate desires can interfere with their ability to accomplish these 
long-term goals. Psychologists have found that when there is a conflict between 
immediate desires and long-term goals, it may be helpful to use a commitment 
device. A commitment device is a plan or arrangement that people make in 
advance to ensure that, if a conflict occurs, they will continue working toward 
their long-term goals instead of choosing to satisfy immediate desires. A 
commitment device forces people to act in their own long-term best interests, 
increasing their chances of successfully reaching their goals.
