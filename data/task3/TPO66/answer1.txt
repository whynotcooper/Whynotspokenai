The concept of a commitment device is a strategy people use in advance to stick to their long-term objectives when faced with conflicting short-term temptations. In the lecture, the professor’s long-term goal was to train for a 10 km race, but his immediate desire was to sleep instead of running in the morning. To overcome this, he created a commitment device by arranging to meet a friend for runs each morning. This plan forced him to prioritize his training because he felt obligated not to let his friend down. As a result, he consistently got up, improved his fitness, and successfully achieved his goal of running the race, perfectly illustrating how a commitment device ensures people act in their long-term best interests.
