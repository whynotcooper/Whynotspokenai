Behavioral Exposure 
Because they fear failure or some other unpleasant consequences, children are 
sometimes afraid to engage in certain behaviors that could be beneficial to them. One 
technique that can help children overcome this kind of fear is behavioral exposure. With 
this technique, children are encouraged to perform gradually increasing amounts of the 
feared behavior. After they are repeatedly exposed to the behavior and experience no 
negative consequences, they gradually become confident that a negative outcome is 
unlikely, and they are eventually able to overcome their fear.
