The concept of behavioral exposure involves helping children conquer fears by encouraging them to perform a feared behavior in small, incremental steps, building confidence through positive experiences. In the lecture, Tommy's fear of talking to other children is overcome using this technique. Initially, his father guides him to give a simple greeting, which the kids return warmly. Then, Tommy advances to making a specific compliment about a bike, receiving an enthusiastic response. These successive, manageable interactions—each more involved than the last—allow Tommy to see that no rejection occurs, easing his anxiety. Eventually, he voluntarily goes out to play, forming new friendships. This example shows how behavioral exposure works by progressively desensitizing a child to a feared scenario through controlled, successful exposures.
