I will first define "behavioral exposure" from the reading as a technique where children perform gradually increasing amounts of a feared behavior to overcome fear through repeated, consequence-free exposure. The connection to the lecture example will be explicitly drawn by showing how Tommy's interactions—starting with a simple greeting, progressing to a compliment, and culminating in independent play—demonstrate this step-by-step process. The response will directly address the question by illustrating how each stage of Tommy's experience aligns with the concept's principles, emphasizing the gradual reduction of fear and building of confidence through controlled, incremental challenges.
