Behavioral exposure is a method where children overcome fears by gradually engaging in a feared activity, starting with small steps and increasing involvement as they gain confidence without negative outcomes. The lecture perfectly illustrates this with Tommy, who feared rejection from neighborhood kids. His father initiated exposure by having Tommy simply say "hi," a low-risk interaction that received positive feedback. Next, Tommy progressed to complimenting a bike, a slightly more engaging step, which also ended positively. Finally, Tommy felt confident enough to ride his bike independently and join the kids, ultimately making friends. This stepwise approach, where each successful interaction reduced his fear, clearly demonstrates behavioral exposure by showing how gradual, repeated exposure to the feared social situation eliminated his anxiety.
