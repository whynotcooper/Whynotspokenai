The concept of near-field sound detection refers to an animal's capacity to perceive air vibrations generated close by, often from predators, thanks to specific bodily adaptations. In the lecture, the professor uses caterpillars as an example. As a wasp flies near, its wing movements produce sound vibrations in the air. The caterpillar's specialized tiny hairs sense these near-field sounds, alerting it to the danger. In response, the caterpillar falls from the branch to escape. This demonstrates how the concept works in practice: the detection mechanism allows the animal to identify an approaching threat and execute a defensive behavior, clearly illustrating near-field sound detection in a real-world scenario.
