Near Field Sound Detection
 Some animals are able to use sound to avoid predators. When sound is produced, it
 creates vibrations in the surrounding air. These vibrations are known as near‐field
 sounds because they originate： or begin, near the sound source. Most animals are
 unable to detect these kinds of sounds; however, some animals have an ability
 known as near‐field sound detection This ability allows certain animals to detect
 vibrations or near‐field sounds produced by potential predators Animals with
 near‐field sound detection abilities have special physical features that allow them to
 sense an approaching predator and take action to protect themselves.
