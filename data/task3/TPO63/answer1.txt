Near-field sound detection is an ability some animals have to sense vibrations in the air produced by nearby sources, like predators, using specialized physical traits. The professor's example of the caterpillar perfectly illustrates this. When a wasp approaches, the beating of its wings creates air vibrations, which are near-field sounds. The caterpillar has tiny hairs on its skin that detect these vibrations, allowing it to sense the wasp's presence. This triggers a protective response: the caterpillar drops off the branch to avoid being caught. Thus, the example shows how near-field sound detection, through unique features, enables animals to perceive threats and take evasive action, directly relating to the concept's definition.
