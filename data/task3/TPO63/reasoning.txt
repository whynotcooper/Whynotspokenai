The task requires explaining how the lecture example illustrates the concept of near-field sound detection. First, I will define the concept from the reading: it is an ability where animals detect vibrations in the air (near-field sounds) from nearby sources, using special physical features to sense predators and protect themselves. Then, I will connect this to the lecture's caterpillar example by highlighting how the caterpillar's tiny hairs detect vibrations from the wasp's wingbeats, allowing it to sense the predator and drop to safety. This directly shows the illustrative relationship—the example demonstrates the concept's key elements: detection of near-field sounds via specialized features and subsequent protective action. I will ensure both answers explicitly follow the question's instructions, use varied phrasing, and stay within the word limit while accurately reflecting the materials.
