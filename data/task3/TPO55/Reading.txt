 Ecosystem Resilience
 An ecosystem is a local environment with its complex community of organisms
 functioning together as a unit. An ecosystem can be damaged by natural disasters or
 by humanactivity. If the ecosystem has a limited variety of species, then destroying
 even one species of plant or animal can change the ecosystem forever. A resilient
 ecosystem, however, is able to restore itself to its original, pre‐disturbance condition.
 Resilience in an ecosystem is possible when the ecosystem is populated by a large
 variety of species: if one species is eliminated by a disturbance, other species are
 able to take the place of that species, which allows the ecosystem to avoid long‐term
 change
