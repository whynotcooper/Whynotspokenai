I will first define the academic concept of "ecosystem resilience" from the reading, which is an ecosystem's ability to restore itself after a disturbance due to its high species variety. Then, I will connect this directly to the lecture's coral reef example, explaining how the reef's biodiversity allowed other fish species to compensate for the loss of the algae-eating fish, preventing long-term damage from algae overgrowth. This will explicitly follow the task by using the coral reef to illustrate the concept, highlighting the cause-and-effect relationship between species diversity and ecosystem recovery.
