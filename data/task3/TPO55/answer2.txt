An ecosystem is resilient if it can bounce back to its pre-disturbance condition, a trait enabled by substantial biodiversity. This is exemplified by the coral reef case. After a fuel spill eliminated a particular algae-eating fish, the system risked being overrun by algae, damaging the coral. Yet, the reef's diversity meant numerous other fish species shared the same diet. These alternative consumers proliferated in response to the abundant algae, assuming the ecological role of the extinct species. Thus, the reef avoided permanent alteration and restored its balance, showcasing how species variety grants an ecosystem the flexibility to withstand and recover from shocks.
