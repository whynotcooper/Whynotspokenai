Ecosystem resilience refers to an ecosystem's capacity to recover its original state after a disruption, which depends on having a wide variety of species. The coral reef example clearly illustrates this. When pollution killed off one species of fish that consumed algae, the reef initially faced a threat of algae overgrowth, which could harm the coral. However, because the reef had high biodiversity, other fish species that also eat algae were present. These species increased in number due to the extra food supply, effectively replacing the function of the lost fish. Consequently, the algae population was controlled, and the reef returned to its prior condition, demonstrating resilience through species redundancy.
