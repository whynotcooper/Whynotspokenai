Now, listen to a lecture on this topic in a psychology class. Okay, here's an example. Last week I went shopping for a pair of jeans. I hadn't bought jeans in years, and boy, was I in for a surprise. You see all I wanted was regular jeans but when I told it to the salesperson he looked at me as though I were from Mars. he explained I could choose between five different styles straight or baggy and I don't know what else. and a dozen colors and on top of that did I want buttons or zipper Now it used to be there were only a couple of jeans types, and it was easy for me to decide what I wanted. now with all these different possibilities, shopping was hard I went back and forth, this pair was really comfortable, but this other one was the most fashionable and there were at least four different colors that looked really good Finally I did settle on one but what used to take five minutes had turned into a two hour project before the choice was basically dark blue or light blue period Maybe the fit wasn't perfect, but deciding was easy, but now now I had a complex and time consuming problem on my hands. Plus all the back and forth actually gave me a headache was I making the right decision how could I be sure Sure, it was only a pair of jeans, but I left the store anxious rather than satisfied with my purchase.Explain what is meant by the paradox of choice using the example mentioned by the professor.
