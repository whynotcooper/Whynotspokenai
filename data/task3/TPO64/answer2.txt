Paradox of choice refers to the counterintuitive situation where increased options, instead of enhancing satisfaction, often result in greater stress and indecision. This is clearly demonstrated by the professor’s anecdote about jean shopping. Faced with an array of styles, colors, and fastenings, he found the process exhausting and complex, leading to prolonged deliberation and even a headache. Ultimately, he felt uneasy about his purchase, highlighting that the multitude of choices created anxiety. Therefore, the example underscores the paradox: more freedom of choice unexpectedly generates dissatisfaction, aligning with the concept’s definition.
