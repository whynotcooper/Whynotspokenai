Paradox of Choice
 The freedom to make choices and decisions makes people happy because it gives
 them a sense of being in control of their lives. However, the fact that having some
 choice is good does not mean that having more choice is necessarily better, since
 having too many choices can cause anxiety and dissatisfaction. The main reason for
 this is that as the number of options available to us increases, the effort required to
 make a good decision increases as well This phenomenon has been termed the
 paradox of choice: we like having choices and think that having more choices should
 please us; but instead, it causes us distress.
