I will first define the "paradox of choice" as the psychological phenomenon where having some choice is beneficial, but excessive options lead to anxiety and dissatisfaction. Then, I will connect this directly to the professor's jeans-shopping example, showing how the overwhelming variety of styles, colors, and features transformed a simple decision into a stressful, time-consuming ordeal. This illustrates the paradox by demonstrating that while the professor expected more choices to be better, they actually caused distress and regret, aligning perfectly with the concept's definition. The response will explicitly follow the task by using the example to explain the concept.
