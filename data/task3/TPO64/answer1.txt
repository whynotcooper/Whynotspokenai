The paradox of choice is the idea that while having some freedom of choice is positive, an overabundance of options can actually lead to anxiety and dissatisfaction. The professor’s experience buying jeans perfectly illustrates this. He expected a simple purchase but was confronted with numerous styles, colors, and features like zippers or buttons. This overwhelming variety made the decision difficult and time-consuming, turning what used to be a quick, easy choice into a stressful, two-hour ordeal. He felt anxious, second-guessing his selection, and left the store less satisfied. Thus, the example shows how too many choices, contrary to expectation, can cause distress rather than pleasure.
