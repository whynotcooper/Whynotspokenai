 Root Communication
 All plants need water in order to grow. In desert environments, however, water is
 especially scarce. One way that some desert plants attempt to secure an adequate
 water supply is by maintaining a certain distance between themselves and other
 plants that might try to compete for the same water They maintain this distance
 through a process known as root communication. That is, the roots of one plant
 communicate with the roots of another plant in order to control the amount of
 distance separating them In this way: the communicating plant is able to protect its
 precious water supply.
