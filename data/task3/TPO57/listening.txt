Now listen to part of a lecture in a botany class so here's one example of this researchers have been studying a particular plant that lives in the desert it's called a creosote plant Now when you look at creosote plants you notice something unusual about them right away you see that their space far away from other plants and as it turns out there's a reason for that like other plants a creosote plant has a root system underneath the ground that provides the plant with access to the water the plant needs to survive and the creosote plant has a special way of protecting the space around its roots more specifically of protecting the water in the space around its roots What it does is whenever the roots of other plant start growing too close the roots of the creosote release a chemical and when the roots of the other plants come into contact with this chemical they stop growing toward the creosote roots and start growing in some other direction away from the creosote plant so in a way the creosote roots with this chemical they release are telling the roots of the other plants this is my space and my water and the other plants get the message and move away So this way the roots of the creosote plant always have plenty of space around them and in a dry desert climate that's a big advantageU the example of the creosote plant from the lecture explain how root communication helps desert plants to survive.
