The concept of root communication describes how desert plants use their root systems to maintain distance from competitors, thereby protecting their limited water supply. The creosote plant provides a clear illustration of this. Its roots release a special chemical when other plants' roots start growing too close. Upon contact with this chemical, the intruding roots cease their advance and grow in a different direction. In this way, the creosote plant is effectively communicating, sending a signal that defines its territory. This process ensures that the creosote's roots have sufficient space around them. Consequently, in an arid desert environment where water is extremely scarce, this communication directly helps the plant survive by securing exclusive access to the vital water in its immediate vicinity.
