Now, listen to part of a lecture in a biology class Now this can be seen in a certain type of small fish called the minnow minnows are hunted by a larger fish called a lake trout Some minnows have learned to react to the smell of lake trout, mainly by gathering close together and not moving around much because this makes it harder for lake trout to find and eat the minnows, So scientists explored the phenomenon we've been talking about by conducting an experiment, they exposed the group of minnows to the odors of two different kinds of fish that the minnows had never seen before, one kind was another species of trout called a brook trout which even though a different species was still similar in some ways to lake trout The other kind of fish was not a trout at all, it was a totally different kind of fish, So when the minnows smelled the brook trout, they knew it smelled similar to the lake trout so they behaved the same way as when they smelled the lake trout that is they gathered close together and didn't move much, even though theyd never encountered the brook trout before, but when they smelled the other type of fish, the one that wasn't a trout They behaved normally they did not respond as if they sensed they were in danger.
