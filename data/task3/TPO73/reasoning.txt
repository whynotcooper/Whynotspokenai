The task requires explaining how the lecture's example illustrates the reading's concept of "generalization to avoid predators." First, I will define generalization as animals identifying unfamiliar predators by their similarity to known ones and responding with avoidance behaviors. Then, I will connect this to the minnow example by showing how minnows, familiar with lake trout, generalized their avoidance response to brook trout due to similarity (odor/species), but not to a dissimilar fish. This directly illustrates the concept's core mechanism—similarity drives generalization—and fulfills the instruction to explain the relationship. The response will highlight the contrast between similar (brook trout) and dissimilar fish to emphasize how generalization varies with similarity.
