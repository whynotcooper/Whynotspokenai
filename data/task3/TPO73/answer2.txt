The concept of generalization to avoid predators refers to animals recognizing new threats based on similarities to familiar predators and responding identically to stay safe. This is clearly shown in the minnow case. Minnows that avoid lake trout by gathering tightly when smelling them were tested with odors from a brook trout—closely related and similar—and an unrelated fish. Upon detecting the brook trout's scent, which resembled that of the known predator, the minnows generalized, immediately clustering and reducing movement as if facing lake trout. In contrast, the odor of the dissimilar fish provoked no such reaction. Thus, the example highlights how generalization occurs primarily when unfamiliar animals share traits with known dangers.
