 Generalization to Avoid Predators
 For animals to avoid predators and stay safe, they need to be able to identify
 which other animals might be dangerous predators. Animals can sometimes
 recognize new predators by their similarity to predators they are familiar with.
 This phenomenon is known as generalization. When they encounter an
 unfamiliar animal that has the same characteristics as a known predator, they
 generalize by behaving the same way they would to avoid the known predator.
 An animal's ability to generalize can vary based or how similar the unfamiliar
 animals are to the original predators; the more similar they are, the more likely
 the animal is to generalize.
