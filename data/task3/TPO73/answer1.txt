Generalization is when animals identify unfamiliar predators by their resemblance to known ones and react with the same avoidance behaviors. The minnow example perfectly illustrates this. Minnows learned to avoid lake trout by clustering together when sensing their odor. In an experiment, they were exposed to two unfamiliar fish: brook trout, which are similar to lake trout, and a completely different fish. When smelling the similar brook trout, the minnows generalized, reacting with the same clustering behavior as for lake trout, even though they'd never encountered one. However, with the dissimilar fish, they behaved normally, showing no generalization. This demonstrates that generalization depends on similarity, as the concept describes.
