The reading proposes canceling new-student orientation information sessions because students forget the early information and can access it all on the university website later. In the listening, the woman disagrees with this proposal. She gives two reasons for her opinion. First, she argues that some information is very useful right away. For example, she learned about the student book fair during the session, which allowed her to buy cheaper used books and save money. Second, she believes students wouldn't bother checking the website on their own due to busy schedules with classes and events, so they would miss out on important resources if the sessions were canceled.
