For this task, I must first summarize the reading's proposal, which is to cancel the new-student orientation information sessions. The proposal gives two reasons: the information isn't helpful early on and is forgotten, and it's all available on the university website. The listening features a female student who disagrees with this proposal. I need to clearly state her opinion and explain her two supporting reasons, which are: 1) some information is immediately useful, illustrated by the book fair example that saved money, and 2) students are unlikely to proactively search the website due to busy schedules, so they'd miss important information. My response must directly answer the prompt by summarizing the proposal, stating her opinion, and explaining her reasons, all within 100–120 words per answer, using the provided details without adding or omitting anything.
