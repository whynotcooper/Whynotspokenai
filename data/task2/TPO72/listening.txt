Now, listen to two students discussing the letter. What do you think of his idea. I don't know. I'm not sure I agree. Oh, really, why is that? Well, we don't need to know all that stuff right away. but I mean, some of the stuff was really useful. Yeah, I suppose, like, for instance, I learned about the student book fair where a lot of students sell their used books once they don't need anymore. right, the book fair. Yeah, I would have just bought all my books at the bookstore. But instead, I waited and went to the book fair to buy used books straight from the students, And that saved me a lot of money. Me too. but, what about what he said about the website. if that's true then Well, sure, but it just seems unrealistic to me that students would ever do that. I mean, think about it. when was the last time you ever used the website like that. I guess never, exactly, same for me. And most students probably don't and wouldn't bother. imagine if the university did what he's suggesting. who's got the time. Yeah, I know with all the other stuff I've got going on, right, classes, campus events and everything. I just don't see students bother and go to the website using it like that. And so they just end up missing out and a lot of important stuff they should know..
