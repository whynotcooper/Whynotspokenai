Cancel Information Sessions
 At the beginning of each year, during new-student orientation, the university
 holds information sessions to provide students with general information about
 resources available at the university. l think that these sessions should be
 canceled. This is because a lot of the information presented during these
 sessions is not helpful at the beginning of the year. Students tend to forget
 what they have heard and so are not able to benefit from the information.
 Additionally, the sessions are unnecessary because all the information
 presented is available on the university website. The students can access the
 information when they need it.
 Sincerely,
 Paul Clark
