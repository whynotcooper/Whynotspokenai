According to the reading, the university should reduce the book borrowing period to two weeks from one month, claiming it's sufficient for reading and cuts wait times for others. The woman opposes this idea. Her first reason is that for research papers, students may need a book for a full month to consult it multiple times as they write, not just to read it quickly. Secondly, she explains that students who need a book urgently have the option of interlibrary loan—by filling out a form with a librarian, they can get the book from another library in a few days, so shortening the loan period isn't the only solution to availability issues.
