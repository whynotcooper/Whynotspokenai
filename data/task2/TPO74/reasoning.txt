For this Integrated Speaking Task, I will first summarize the reading's proposal to limit the borrowing period for library books from one month to two weeks, based on the two reasons provided: that two weeks is sufficient reading time and that it would reduce wait times for other students. Next, I will clearly state the woman's opinion from the listening, which is that she disagrees with the proposal. I will then explain her two reasons in detail: first, that students often need books for longer than two weeks for research papers, as they require ongoing reference over a month; and second, that the interlibrary loan system provides a faster alternative for students who urgently need a book, taking only a few days. My response will directly address the question by covering all these elements concisely, ensuring it stays within 100–120 words and uses natural speech patterns without adding or omitting any source information.
