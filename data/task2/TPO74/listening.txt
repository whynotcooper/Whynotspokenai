Now, listen to two students discussing the letter Did you read this letter Yes, he makes some good points you think so I don't agree with him why not Well to begin with he's not thinking about how students actually use the books What do you mean Well if you're using it to write a paper even if it's possible to read the book quickly you still need to hold on to it for reference like say you're working on a research paper over the course of a month you may need to go back and refer to things in the book to figure out what you're going to use in the paper I guess that's true it can take time if you're using it for research there's a whole process involved and I don't like his other reason either but sometimes students really need a book for an assignment and they can't wait that's true but if students can't wait for a book there's another way they can get it they can order it from another library in the state university library system it's called an interlibrary loan how do you do that Well, for an interlibrary loan, students can just go to the librarian at our library and fill out a form they put down the title an author of the book they want and then our librarian finds it at another school's library then that library sends it to our it only takes a few days.
