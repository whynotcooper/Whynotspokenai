Limit Borrowing Period for Library Books
 Currently,students are permitted to borrow library books and take them
 home for one month before they have to return them. l think the university
 lib rary should limit the borrowing period to two weeks. First of all, l think
 most students will agree that they do not need a whole month to read a
 book-tw o weeks is enough tim e. Plus students who are waiting for a book to
 be returned so they can use it won't have to wait as long as they do now.
 This way they won't fall behind with their assignments.
