The reading proposes shortening the library book borrowing period from one month to two weeks. The writer argues that two weeks is enough time to read a book and that it would reduce waiting times for other students needing materials for assignments. However, the woman in the conversation disagrees with this proposal. She gives two reasons for her opinion. First, she points out that students often use books for research papers over a month, needing to refer back to them repeatedly during the writing process. Second, she mentions that if students can't wait for a book, they can use the interlibrary loan system, which allows them to request books from other libraries and receive them in just a few days, making the shorter borrowing period unnecessary.
