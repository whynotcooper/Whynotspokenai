For this task, I must first summarize the university's new policy from the reading: matching roommates based on similar interests instead of randomly, aiming to improve first-year experiences and reduce room-change requests. Then, I need to state the female student's opinion clearly—she disagrees with the plan. Her two main reasons are: 1) similar interests aren't necessary for friendship, as she and her roommate have different majors and hobbies but get along well, and 2) room changes won't decrease significantly because people move for other reasons like schedules or location, not just differing interests. My response must directly address the question by stating her opinion and explaining both reasons concisely, without adding or omitting details, and within the word limit for a natural 60-second speech.
