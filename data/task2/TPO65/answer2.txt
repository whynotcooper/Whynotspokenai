According to the reading, the university will assign roommates based on similar interests to enhance student satisfaction and lower housing office workload from fewer room switches. The woman opposes this change. Her first reason is that compatibility doesn't require common interests; she illustrates this with her own roommate, who has divergent academic focuses and leisure pursuits, but they maintain a great relationship. Additionally, she contends that room-change rates won't drop much because students may still move due to factors like differing daily routines or preferred dorm locations, not merely interest mismatches. Therefore, she finds the plan unnecessary and unlikely to achieve its goals.
