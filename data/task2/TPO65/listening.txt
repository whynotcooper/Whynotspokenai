now listen to two students discussing the newspaper article you know this makes
 so much sense i wonder why it took them so long oh i don't think it makes sense
  why not well i don't think you need to have similar interests to make friends look
   at my roommate in me we're completely different i mean she's a french major and i'm 
   studying biochemistry she's really into sports and i well let's just say i'm not very
    athletic yeah but you guys are good friends exactly that's my point we get along great
     i see but you have to admit there are a lot of cases where yeah i know cases where people
      decide they have to move out but well nobody moves out just because they don't have the same
       interests as their roommate maybe they have very different schedules or or they have a chance
        to move to a better location yeah anyway my point is that there's no reason to expect a big drop
         people are still going want to move for all kinds of reasons
