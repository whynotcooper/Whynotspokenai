The university plans to match roommates by similar interests to improve first-year experiences and reduce room-change requests. However, the woman disagrees with this new policy. First, she argues that shared interests aren't essential for friendship. She gives a personal example: she and her roommate have different majors—biochemistry versus French—and contrasting hobbies, like sports versus non-athletic activities, yet they get along very well. Second, she believes the plan won't significantly decrease room changes. People request moves for various reasons unrelated to interests, such as conflicting schedules or wanting a better dorm location. Thus, she feels the university's expectations are unrealistic.
