For this task, I must first summarize the reading, which proposes converting an empty room in the Math Building into a small cafeteria with added electrical outlets. Then, I need to clearly state the woman's opinion from the listening—she agrees with the proposal. I will explain her two reasons: the convenience of having food nearby without the long walk to the Student Center, and the benefit of having outlets to recharge laptops, which is currently not possible in the old building. My response must directly address the question by describing the improvement and the woman's agreement, ensuring all details come from the provided sources without adding, omitting, or distorting any information.
