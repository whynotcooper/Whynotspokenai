According to the reading, the improvement involves turning an unused room in the Math Building into a cafeteria and installing electrical outlets for laptop charging. The woman fully agrees with this proposal. Her first reason is that it offers great convenience; the Student Center is too distant, making it hard to eat between classes without being late. Secondly, she likes the outlet idea because students often use laptops in math classes and need to recharge them. Since the building is old and lacks charging spots, this would provide a perfect place to power up devices and relax or study during breaks, addressing both needs effectively.
