The reading proposes converting an empty room in the Math Building into a small cafeteria with added electrical outlets for recharging laptops. The woman in the conversation agrees with this suggestion. First, she points out that the closest place to eat is the Student Center, which is far across campus. There isn't enough time between classes to walk there and back, so a nearby cafeteria would be very convenient. Second, she supports the idea of adding outlets because many students bring laptops to math classes and need to recharge them. Currently, the old Math Building has no places for this, so the improvement would allow students to recharge devices and get work done between classes.
