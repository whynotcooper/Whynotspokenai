 Cafeteria for Math Building
 Students who are majoring in math spend a lot of time in the math building. I think it
 would be more convenient for math students if the university turned the large
 empty room on the first floor of the math building into a small cafeteria Having a
 cafeteria in the math building would give students a place where they could get
 something to eat in between classes. Additionally, the university could add a
 number of electrical outlets to the room so students could recharge their laptops
 there.
