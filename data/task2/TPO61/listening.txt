now listen to two students discussing the letter did you see this letter of justins in the paper today i like his idea yeah i did see that i think it's good it would be a real convenience because right now the closest place to get something to eat is that the student center which is all the way across campus you know you're right about that there just isn't enough time to leave the math building make the long walk to the student center and get back in time for your next class i know what you mean so it would be a great place to just have something to eat spend time with friends and slope down a little in between classes and what about his suggestion about the computers oh i really like it because most students bring their laptops to classes especially math classes and they need to recharge their laptops when they're not in class yeah and there are absolutely no places to do that in the math building because it's so old right so like if you have a couple of math classes in a row and some time in between them it would be a good place to sit down and recharge your laptop and maybe get some work done at the same time the letter writer points out a problem with the math building and suggests an improvement briefly describe the improvement and explain the reasons why the woman agrees or disagrees with the letter writer's suggestion😊
