Now, listen to two students discussing the letter. So did you see the letter George wrote in the student paper. What do you think of his idea, It makes sense to me, really, why, Well, it'd be an improvement to campus For one thing, We need more green areas. Wouldn't it be great to get rid of some of the paved area and plant some grass and trees, then we'd have somewhere to hang out with friends and even to study when the weather's warm. That's true. right, And I agree with his other point, too. right now, there's so much traffic on a lot of the campus roads. It's hard to get across some of the streets. It's even worse trying to get around on my bike. I finally gave up. exactlyact, So if parking was only available outside of the main part of campus, more people would want to walk and ride bikes because it would be easier to get around. see your point, it would be easier..
