For this task, I must first summarize the proposal from the reading, which is to close the large parking lot near Thomas Hall to create a green space and reduce campus traffic. Then, I need to state the woman's opinion from the listening—she agrees with the proposal—and explain her two reasons: the need for more green areas for socializing and studying, and the reduction of traffic to make walking and biking safer and easier. I will ensure the response is concise, directly addresses the question, and accurately reflects both sources without adding or omitting details.
