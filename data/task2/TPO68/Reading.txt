University Should Close Parking Area 
I think the university should close the large parking lot near the main classroom building on 
campus, Thomas Hall. This lot occupies a large space in the center of campus. Closing it to 
vehicle parking would have two big benefits. First, the space could be turned into a pleasant, 
grassy area. And second, since this would reduce the traffic on campus, students will be 
more likely to ride their bikes or walk to classes.
