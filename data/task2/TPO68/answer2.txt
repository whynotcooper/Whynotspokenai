According to the reading, the university should close the parking lot by Thomas Hall to turn it into a green space and cut down on traffic, promoting biking and walking.

Two, reducing traffic would address safety issues, as she finds it hard to bike or navigate roads now, and this change would encourage more people to choose active transportation.
