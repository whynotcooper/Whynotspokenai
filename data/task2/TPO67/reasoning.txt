For this Integrated Speaking Task, I will first summarize the reading's key points: the Student Association purchased a new sound system for the Old Lincoln Hall auditorium to improve movie experiences and increase ticket sales, based on a survey showing movies were students' top entertainment choice. The listening clearly states the man's opinion that this was a bad decision and a waste of money. I must explain his two reasons: first, the old building's terrible acoustics will prevent any sound improvement despite the new equipment; second, the survey results are misleading because limited campus activities forced students to rank movies as their top choice. My response will directly address the question by stating his opinion and thoroughly explaining both reasons without adding, omitting, or distorting any information from the sources.
