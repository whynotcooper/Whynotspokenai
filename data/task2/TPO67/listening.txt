Now, listen to two students discussing the announcement. I really think the Student Association made a bad decision. Really, why don't you like going to the movies. Sure I do. but this new purchase is just a waste of money. What do you mean, It's supposed to sound really good. Yeah, well, I'm sure it does, but in Old Lincoln Hall, I mean, that building must be 200 years old. It used to be the college gym. the acoustics are terrible. So you're saying there'll be no improvement. That's right. And also, I seriously doubt that going to the movies is the number one social activity for most students. Yeah, but that's what students said. Well, of course, that's what they said What else is there to do on campus. What do you mean I mean, there isn't much to do on campus besides go to the movies. if there were other forms of recreation or other social activities, You know I don't think most students would have said that going to the movies was their first choice.
