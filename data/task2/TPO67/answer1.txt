The reading announces that the Student Association bought a new sound system for Old Lincoln Hall to enhance movie experiences and boost ticket sales, citing a survey where movies ranked as students' favorite entertainment. The man strongly disagrees with this purchase, considering it a waste of money. His first reason is that the auditorium's terrible acoustics, due to its age and former use as a gym, will prevent any real improvement from the new system. Secondly, he doubts the survey's accuracy, arguing that students only ranked movies first because there are few other social activities on campus. If more options existed, movies might not be the top choice, making the investment unjustified.
