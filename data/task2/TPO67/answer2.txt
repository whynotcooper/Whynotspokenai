According to the reading, the Student Association invested in a new sound system for Old Lincoln Hall to attract more students to movies and increase sales, based on a survey indicating movies are the most popular entertainment. The man opposes this decision, believing it's a poor use of funds. He explains that the old building's acoustics are so bad that the new equipment won't actually improve sound quality. Additionally, he questions the survey results, suggesting students chose movies as their top activity only due to a lack of alternative campus recreations. Thus, he feels the purchase won't achieve its goals and is unnecessary.
