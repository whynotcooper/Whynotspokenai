According to the reading, the university should prohibit sports on the dining hall lawn to reduce grass damage and enhance its look, with students directed to gym fields as an alternative. However, the woman opposes this idea. She explains that the ban wouldn't address the real problem, as daily foot traffic from students crossing the lawn contributes significantly to the wear. Additionally, she notes that the gym fields are on the edge of campus, requiring a long walk that doesn't suit students with short breaks. Therefore, she feels the proposal is unhelpful and fails to consider students' needs for accessible recreation.
