The reading proposes banning sports on the dining hall lawn to prevent grass damage and improve its appearance, suggesting students use fields near the gym instead. The woman disagrees with this proposal. She gives two reasons for her opinion. First, she argues that prohibiting sports wouldn't solve the damage issue because the lawn is centrally located and gets heavy foot traffic from students rushing to class, not just from those playing games. Second, she points out that the alternative fields by the gym are too far away, making them impractical for students who want to relax briefly between classes. Thus, she believes the ban is ineffective and inconvenient.
