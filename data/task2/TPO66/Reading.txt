No Sports on the Dining Hall Lawn 
The open grassy area in front of the dining hall is one of the nicest features of our 
campus. Unfortunately, though,the grass is regularly trampled on and damaged 
by students playing games like soccer and Frisbee, resulting in ugly bare patches 
of dirt. I think the university should prohibit students from playing sports on the 
dining-hall lawn, so that the grass will look nicer. Banning sports from the lawn 
shouldn’t inconvenience anyone, since there are fields next to the gym where 
students can play sports instead.
