For this Integrated Speaking Task, I will first summarize the proposal from the reading, which is to ban sports on the dining hall lawn to prevent grass damage and improve its appearance, noting that students can use fields near the gym instead. Then, I will clearly state the woman's opinion from the listening—she disagrees with the proposal. I must explain her two main reasons: first, that the ban wouldn't solve the damage problem because high foot traffic from students crossing the lawn daily also causes wear, and second, that the alternative fields near the gym are inconveniently located far from central campus, making them impractical for short breaks between classes. My response will directly address the question by covering these elements concisely, using transitions for clarity, and staying within 100–120 words per answer without adding or omitting details.
