The reading proposes extending the study period from one to three days before finals, arguing students need more time to prepare for multiple exams and consult professors. However, the woman opposes this idea. First, she believes it would encourage students to procrastinate, waiting until the last minute to study instead of learning consistently throughout the semester. She emphasizes that effective learning can't be crammed into just a few days. Second, she points out that professors are extremely busy during this time grading assignments and preparing exams, making it difficult for students to schedule appointments or get meaningful help. Thus, she finds the proposal unhelpful.
