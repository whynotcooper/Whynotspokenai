According to the reading, the university should extend the study period to three days to give students additional exam preparation time and opportunities to meet with professors. The woman disagrees with this proposal for two key reasons. Initially, she argues that a longer break might promote poor study habits, as students may delay studying until the end rather than reviewing material gradually. Moreover, she notes that professors are occupied with grading and exam preparation during this period, so they likely won't have availability to assist students effectively. Therefore, she feels the extended study days wouldn't address the real needs and could even be counterproductive.
