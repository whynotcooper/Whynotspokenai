For this Integrated Speaking Task, I will first summarize the reading's proposal to extend the study period from one to three days, focusing on its two main points: allowing more preparation time for multiple exams and providing extra time to consult professors. Then, I will clearly state the woman's opinion from the listening—she disagrees with the proposal. Finally, I will explain her two reasons: that it encourages procrastination instead of consistent studying throughout the semester, and that professors are too busy during that period to effectively help students. My response will directly address the question by integrating these elements concisely, ensuring it stays within the word limit and uses natural transitions without adding or omitting details.
