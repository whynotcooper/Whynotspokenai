now listen to two students discussing the letter so what do you think of robert's letter well i don't know how helpful his idea would be really yeah students should be studying all throughout the semester not waiting until a few days before exams see you don't think we need this right it's just going encourage students to wait and do all of their studying at the end of the semester and you just can't learn at all in a few days okay but what about the other point he mentioned oh that i don't think that's the best time to be asking professors questions about the courses why not well professors are really busy during that period with grading homework assignments and preparing the exams they might not have time to answer students questions it'd be pretty hard to make appointments with professors at that time don't you think yeah they might just not have enough time the woman expresses her opinion about the proposal in the letter briefly summarize the proposal then state her opinion about the proposal and explain the reason she gives for holding that opinion
