 Extending Study Period
 The university now schedules one study day at the end of every semester for
 students to prepare for final exams. I suggest that the university consider extending
 this study period to three days. Most students have exams in several classes. Having
 only one study day between the end of classes and the beginning of the final exam
 period is not enough time to prepare for all of the exams Additionally; having a
 three‐ day study period will give students extra time to con suit with their professors
 if they need help or advice before the exam period begins.
