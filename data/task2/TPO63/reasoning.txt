For this Integrated Speaking Task, I will first summarize the reading's proposal for a new Degree Navigator website. This summary will include its two main functions: helping students track their course requirements and reducing advisors' workloads. Then, I will clearly state the male student's opinion from the listening, which is that he supports the plan. Finally, I will explain his two reasons: 1) It helps students stay organized and avoid missing required courses, preventing graduation delays, and 2) It frees up busy professor-advisors to focus on more serious student issues like major changes or internships. My response will directly answer the prompt by connecting these elements without adding, omitting, or distorting any information from the sources.
