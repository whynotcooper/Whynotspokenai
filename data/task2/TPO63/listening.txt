now listen to two students discussing the article hey this is great did you see this article oh yeah i saw that but do you think we really need it well yeah i think it'll be really helpful because there's actually a lot of different classes you need for some of the degree programs and it can be hard to stay organized and i guess that's true i'm studying business and there are a lot of math and economics courses i have to take right and sometimes students miss a certain course like my friend had to stay on campus over the summer break after his final year to take a class to complete his history degree he had to graduate a few months later oh wow his graduation was delayed yeah because he didn't realize it was something he needed to take until it was too late wow well hopefully this will help people avoid that kind of mistakes since they can just see it online i guess that's good for the advisors too yeah definitely since they're so busy i mean all the academic advisors are professors so they have a lot of other work to do that's true they don't have a lot of extra time right and this way they could have more time to talk to students about more serious issues where students might really need advice like if students have questions about switching majors or doing an internship the man expresses his opinion about the plan described in the article briefly summarize the plan then state his opinion about the plan and explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion
