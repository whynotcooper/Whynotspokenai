 NewDegree Navigator Web Site
 Students must complete certain courses in their fields of study in order to meet the
 requirements for graduation. Currently, students meet with academic advisors to
 discuss these requirements. Soon, though, students will be able to use a new degree
 navigator Web site to keep track of their requirements The Web site will make it
 easier for students to monitor which courses they have already completed and which
 ones they still need to take before graduating, so they can plan their schedules
 accordingly Also, the Web site will help reduce the workload for academic advisors,
 whowill not need to meet with students as often.
