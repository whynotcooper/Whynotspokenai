The reading announces a new Degree Navigator website that will allow students to track their graduation requirements online, showing completed and needed courses for better schedule planning. It also aims to reduce academic advisors' workload by decreasing meeting frequency. The man in the conversation strongly supports this plan. He gives two reasons for his opinion. First, he notes that degree programs often have many required courses, making organization difficult; he mentions a friend whose graduation was delayed because he missed a history requirement, which the website could prevent. Second, he points out that advisors are professors with heavy workloads, so the site would free up their time to discuss more critical issues, like switching majors or internships, where students truly need guidance.
