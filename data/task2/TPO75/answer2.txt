According to the reading, the proposal is to pay theater assistants and offer them training to address problems like unreliability and poor equipment skills. The man in the listening supports this idea. His first reason is that paying assistants would eliminate their need for other jobs, making them more dependable; he cites a friend who missed a rehearsal due to work, which wouldn't happen if the theater job were paid. His second reason is that training is essential because today's equipment is advanced, and step-by-step instruction from professionals would improve assistants' skills, leading to better-run plays and fewer mistakes during shows.
