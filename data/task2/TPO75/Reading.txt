Pay Theater Assistants 
Currently, the assistants who help with the production of plays on campus are student 
volunteers who are not paid or fully trained. I suggest that the theater department should 
pay the assistants who help out with plays and also give them special training. As 
someone who has been in campus productions, I know that using volunteers doesn't 
work because they often arrive late for rehearsals or not at all, and they don't know a lot 
about operating stage equipment. However, paid assistants would be more motivated to 
provide reliable 
help. They would also be able to operate stage equipment more 
effectively because they would have better training. 
Sincerely, 
Sally Smith
