The reading proposes that the theater department should pay student assistants and provide them with specialized training to improve reliability and equipment operation. In the conversation, the man agrees with this proposal. He gives two reasons for his opinion. First, he explains that student volunteers often prioritize paid jobs, leading to missed rehearsals.

Second, he emphasizes that modern stage equipment is complex, so professional training would teach assistants how to operate it correctly, reducing errors and enhancing the quality of performances.
