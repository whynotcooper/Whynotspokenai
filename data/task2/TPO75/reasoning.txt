For this Integrated Speaking Task, I will first summarize the proposal from the reading, which suggests paying theater assistants and providing them with special training to address issues of unreliability and lack of expertise. Then, I will clearly state the man's opinion from the listening—he agrees with the proposal. I will explain his two reasons: first, that paid assistants wouldn't need other jobs, making them more reliable, and second, that proper training is necessary due to the complexity of modern equipment. My response will directly address the question by covering these elements concisely, ensuring all information comes directly from the sources without addition or distortion, and keeping within the 100–120 word range for a natural 60-second speech.
