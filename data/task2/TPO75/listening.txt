Now, listen to two students discussing the letter. Hey, Dan, what about this letter, You think it would help, Oh, definitely, the problem is student assistants have to work at other jobs to make money. So the real jobs always come first. What do you mean, I mean, like one of my friends was working for a show last year as a production assistant. and he didn't show up for play rehearsal one night because his boss for his other job, his real job told him he had to stay late at work. He had no choice. So if hed been paid to do the show. then he wouldn't have needed the other job. It wouldn't have gotten in the way because helping out with the play would have been his main job. I guess that's true. but what about the training thing, Is that necessary. Oh, absolutely. You know, the equipment that assistants have to operate now is a lot more complicated than it used to be. you really need to know what you're doing. So he don't mess up. Yeah, especially on the night of the performance. but having someone professional show them what to do. You know, someone who knows all about the latest equipment show them step by step how to work it. I see what you mean. not only would their skills improve. but the plays would be better too.
