According to the announcement, the university will allow undergraduates to use Perkins Lounge, previously for graduates only, because it's underused and more undergraduate study space is needed. The woman in the conversation is against this plan. Her first reason is that the lounge's current lack of crowds provides a quiet place essential for graduate work, allowing them to think and organize research materials without noise. Her second reason is that the real solution to the undergraduate space issue is to designate new study spaces specifically for them, such as in the new dormitory being built, so the graduate lounge can remain exclusively for graduate student use.
