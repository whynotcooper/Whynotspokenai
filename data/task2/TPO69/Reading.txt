Graduate Study Lounge Now Open to All Students 
The university has decided to change its policy about Perkins Lounge. Previously, this study 
space was reserved for graduate students, but the university will now allow undergraduates 
to use Perkins Lounge as well. The Dean of Students explained: “The space is underutilized 
right now—there aren't a lot of graduate students making use of it—so there's room to allow 
additional students.” She also noted that the university has a problem with insufficient study 
space for undergraduates, since undergraduate enrollment at the university has increased in 
the last few years.
