For this Integrated Speaking Task, I will first summarize the reading's plan: the university is opening the graduate-only Perkins Lounge to undergraduates due to underutilization and a shortage of undergraduate study space. Next, I will clearly state the female student's opinion from the listening: she disagrees with the plan. Then, I will explain her two reasons: 1) The lounge's current quiet, uncrowded nature is essential for graduate students' focused work and research, which would be lost if undergraduates used it. 2) The university should solve the undergraduate space problem by creating new, dedicated study areas, such as in the new dormitory, instead of taking away the graduate students' designated space. My response will directly address the question by covering these elements concisely, ensuring all information comes directly from the sources without addition or distortion.
