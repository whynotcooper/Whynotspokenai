Now, listen to two graduate students discussing the announcement. Hey, did you see this, Yeah, I was a little disappointed. Well, it's true that there really aren't a lot of grad students in there, I know that I just don't see why that's a bad thing, I think it's perfect the way it is now, Oh, why is that, Well, I mean, the fact that it's never packed. That's exactly why we like it. It's a quiet space to sit and think. and it's really nice to have a place to spread out our books on the table. especially when we're working on research projects. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, And since we have a lot of work as graduate students, It's really nice for us to have a space that isn't noisy and crowded. Yeah, and if they do this, it won't be that way anymore more. in all fairness, though, the undergrads do need somewhere to go, right, especially since there are more of them now than there used to be. I know. I just feel like to really address that problem. the university should designate extra places for them specifically, like where, Well, I know they're building a new dormitory. So maybe they could add a study space for them there. And that way they could leave this one just for us. Hey, that's a pretty good idea..😊
