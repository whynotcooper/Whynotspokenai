The university plans to open the graduate study lounge, Perkins Lounge, to undergraduate students. This change is due to the lounge being underutilized by graduates and a need for more undergraduate study space because of increased enrollment. The female student opposes this plan. First, she values the lounge's quiet, uncrowded environment, which is perfect for graduate students to concentrate and spread out materials for research projects. She worries this peaceful atmosphere will disappear if undergraduates use the lounge. Second, she believes the university should address the undergraduate space shortage by creating new, specific study areas for them, like in the new dormitory, rather than taking away the graduates' dedicated space.
