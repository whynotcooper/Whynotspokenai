Now, listen to two students discussing the announcement Did you read the announcement Yeah, but you know, I really don't think it'll be that beneficial how come it seems all right I know they need some volunteers in town to work at the youth center Well it's a nice idea but making a mandatory will probably have the opposite effect from what the announcement says it's a great thing for the university to encourage and all but having a requirement that's going to cause resentment not inspire students to volunteer more will'll probably all fulfill the requirement then try to avoid volunteering in the future it'll leave a bad taste in my mouth I'm afraid I can see that and also I mean it's great that there's opportunities nearby but still most of them probably aren't within walking distance like the park they're always looking for volunteers to clean the area but most students including me don't have cars on campus mean neither and there isn't much public transportation either even if these places are local how are we supposed to get there it's just not practical the woman expresses her opinion of the university's new policy state her opinion and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion please prepare your answer after the beep.
