The reading announces a new university policy requiring all students to complete ten hours of volunteer work before graduating, claiming it provides personal satisfaction and is convenient due to nearby organizations. However, the woman in the conversation strongly disagrees with this mandatory policy. She gives two reasons for her view. First, she argues that making volunteering compulsory will likely cause resentment among students. Instead of inspiring continued community service, they might just fulfill the requirement and avoid volunteering in the future. Second, she points out that while opportunities are local, many aren't within walking distance. Since most students lack cars and public transportation is limited, getting there is impractical, undermining the convenience claim.
