For this Integrated Speaking Task, I will first summarize the key points from the reading: the new university policy requiring 10 hours of community volunteer work for graduation, citing benefits like personal satisfaction and convenience due to local opportunities. Then, I will clearly state the female student's opinion from the listening—she opposes the policy—and explain her two main reasons: )
1) Making it mandatory could cause resentment and reduce future volunteering, and 2) Despite local organizations, transportation is impractical for students without cars or public transit. I must ensure my response directly answers the prompt by stating her opinion and explaining her reasons, without adding, omitting, or distorting information, and keep each answer within 100–120 words for a natural 60-second speech.
