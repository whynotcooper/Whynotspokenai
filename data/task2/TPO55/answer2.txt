According to the reading, the university is implementing a graduation requirement of ten volunteer hours, emphasizing benefits like student fulfillment and the convenience of local organizations. In contrast, the woman expresses a negative opinion about this policy. She believes it will not achieve its intended effects. Her first reason is that mandating volunteer work could lead to student resentment, potentially discouraging future volunteering rather than encouraging it. Secondly, she notes that accessibility is a problem; although organizations are nearby, they aren't easily reachable for students without personal vehicles or reliable public transit, making the policy inconvenient in practice despite the university's assurances.
