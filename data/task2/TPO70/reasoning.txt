For this Integrated Speaking Task, I must first summarize the plan from the reading, which describes a university proposal to convert a grassy field into a parking lot to address parking shortages for commuter students. Next, I need to clearly state the woman's opinion from the listening—she disagrees with the plan. Then, I must explain her two main reasons for opposing it: first, that the field is actively used by students for relaxation and study, and second, that the parking shortage claim is unfounded because existing dormitory lots are underutilized and the location is inconvenient for commuters. My response must directly address the question, stay within 100–120 words, and accurately reflect only the provided information without adding or omitting details.
