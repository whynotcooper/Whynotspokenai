The university plans to replace a grassy field near dorms with a parking lot to create more spaces for commuter students who struggle to find parking. The woman opposes this proposal. First, she argues the field is valuable for student life, as many use it to relax, study outdoors, or socialize, and such open areas are scarce on campus. Second, she disputes the need for more parking, noting that existing dormitory lots are never full. Additionally, she points out that commuters prefer lots closer to academic buildings, and this field is a 15-minute walk from campus core, making it an impractical solution.
