According to the article, the university intends to turn a grassy field into a parking lot to alleviate parking issues for commuter students. The woman strongly disagrees with this plan. Her first reason is that the field serves an important purpose; students frequently use it for studying, napping, or hanging out, and campus lacks enough such relaxing spaces. Her second reason is that the parking shortage isn't valid—dorm parking lots are underused, and commuters wouldn't use this lot since it's far from classrooms, requiring a long walk. Thus, she believes the plan is unnecessary and would remove a beneficial student area.
