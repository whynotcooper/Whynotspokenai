Now, listen to two students discussing the letter. Did you see Jason's letter in the paper What do you think I think he's wrong. that field is useful to students. it's used all the time just because it isn't used for sports anymore doesn't mean it's useless plenty of people go there to relax or study and stuff't you Yeah sometimes I think students who live in the nearby dorms hang out there a lot. It's a nice spot That's what I'm saying and it's great to just have an open area like that. someplace you can study outside or take a nap or whatever we don't have enough places like that on campus. I don't want to see it covered over with pavement and a bunch of cars. Yes it would be kind of a shame and I don't believe what he says about needing it either what do you mean it's right next to all the dorms but there's already enough parking at every dorm and those lots are never full as it is true, but some students commute and most of them would rather park the lots that are closer to the classroom buildings It's at least a 15 minute walk from Sandersfield Yeah it's not that close to the main part of campus.The woman disagrees with the parking lot proposal presented in the university paper Ex the proposal and the reasons the woman gives for opposing it.
