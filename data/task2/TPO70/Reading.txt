University Library to Make Changes
 Some of the library's books are used only infrequently. Beginning next semester,
 books that have not been borrowed in the past five years will be removed from the
 library shelves. According to the head librarian, the goal is to create space for new
 books that the library expects to acquire in the future. The removed books will be
 digitized their pages will be scanned and made available electronically through the
 library's website. Students who wish to access these books for any reason will be
 able to view the complete text easily on a computer.
