Improving Dormitory Kitchen Use
 I've noticed that most students don't use the dormitory kitchens, which is
 unfortunate since students would probably enjoy preparing their own food. I think
 that the university should make improvements to the dormitory kitchens so that
 they will be more widely used. There are a few things that the university could do to
 encourage students to start using the kitchens regularly. First: I think the kitchens
 should be modernized with new cookware for students to use. Also, I think free
 cooking classes should be given to stimulate students' interest in cooking and make
 them want to use the kitchens.
