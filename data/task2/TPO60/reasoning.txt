For this Integrated Speaking Task, I will first summarize the proposal from the reading, which suggests two improvements to encourage dormitory kitchen use: modernizing the cookware and offering free cooking classes. Then, I will clearly state the male student's opinion from the listening, which is that he agrees with the proposal. I will explain his two reasons: his personal negative experience with old, inconvenient kitchenware demonstrates the need for modernization, and his belief that cooking classes would be popular because many students lack basic skills but others could teach, making it a fun, communal activity. My response will directly answer the prompt by linking these reasons back to why he supports the proposal, ensuring all information comes directly from the sources without addition or distortion.
