The proposal in the letter suggests two changes to improve dormitory kitchen usage: first, modernizing the kitchens with new cookware, and second, offering free cooking classes to stimulate student interest. The man in the conversation agrees with this proposal. He supports the first point because of a personal experience where he found the kitchen inconvenient, citing an old, battered teapot and missing cups, which discouraged him from using the kitchen again. He believes new equipment would make a real difference. Secondly, he agrees with the cooking classes, noting many students lack basic cooking skills, but others who are knowledgeable could teach, making it a fun and engaging way to learn new recipes together.
