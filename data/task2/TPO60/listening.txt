now listen to two students discussing the letter did you see the letter in the paper about the kitchens yeah i did what did you think oh i really like her ideas she's right that no one really cooks in there now i know i sure don't after my own experience what was that well i came back to the dorm one night all wet from getting caught in a rainstorm and i just wanted to warm up with a cup of tea so i went into the kitchen but all i could find was this battered old teapot that was been out of shape and there were no cups around at all that doesn't sound like fun it wasn't and frankly it was so inconvenient that i never use the kitchen again but having some nice new stuff could make a real difference and what about her other suggestion do you think you'd want to go to them oh definitely and i think other students would too because a lot of us come here without basic skills but there are students here who actually know quite a lot about cooking and i'll bet they would be willing to teach the rest of us what they know great idea it would probably make more students want to go to them right and learning new recipes together would be fun there are so many cool things to cook the students are discussing a proposal suggested in a letter written to the university newspaper briefly summarize the proposal and explain why the man agrees or disagrees with it😊
