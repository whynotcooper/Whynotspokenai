According to the reading, the music department will sponsor free monthly lunchtime concerts performed by students in the music building lounge, including various music styles and complimentary snacks at intermission. The woman expresses a positive opinion about this plan. She supports it because, firstly, it allows music students to perform more often; currently, there's only one end-of-year concert where each student plays just one piece, leaving much learned material unperformed. Secondly, she highlights the convenience of the free snacks, noting the music building's remote location—a 15-minute walk from dining areas—so attendees pressed for time between classes can easily grab a bite.
