For this Integrated Speaking Task, I will first summarize the campus plan from the reading, which is the proposal for monthly lunchtime student concerts in the music building lounge, featuring various music genres and free snacks during intermission. Then, I will clearly state the female student's opinion from the listening—she strongly supports the plan. Finally, I will explain her two key reasons: first, it provides more performance opportunities for music students beyond the single annual concert, allowing them to play multiple pieces they've learned; second, the free snacks are convenient since the music building is isolated from dining areas, helping students who are busy between classes. My response will directly address the question by covering these elements concisely, using natural transitions and staying within 100–120 words per answer, ensuring all information is accurately derived from the provided sources without addition or distortion.
