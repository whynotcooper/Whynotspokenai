The university's plan is to host monthly lunchtime concerts in the music building lounge, featuring student performances of classical, jazz, and popular music, with free snacks available during a ten-minute intermission. The woman in the conversation is very supportive of this proposal. She gives two main reasons for her opinion. First, she points out that currently, music students only have one annual concert, so they typically perform just one piece despite learning many. This new series would offer more frequent opportunities to showcase their repertoire. Second, she appreciates the free snacks because the music building is far from dining halls—about a 15-minute walk—so students squeezing concerts between classes can still have a light meal without inconvenience.
