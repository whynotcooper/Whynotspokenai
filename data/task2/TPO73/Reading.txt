 Reading Passage
 Concerts on the Lawn
 Several music students-friends of mine-have recently formed a new jazz band.
 I'd like to recommend that the university invite this jazz band to play some
 free concerts or campus.These concerts could take place in the afternoon:
 students would enjoy hearing live music while they relax between classes and
 other afternoon activities. And a perfect location for the concerts would be the
 open lawn area near the student center. Many students are in this area during
 the day,and the lawn has recently been improved; it's now a nice area where
 students can sit and enjoy the music.
 Sincerely, Tim Sutcliffe
