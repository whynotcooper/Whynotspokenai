The reading proposes that the university host free afternoon jazz concerts on the lawn near the student center, suggesting it would provide relaxing live music for students between classes. However, the woman in the listening disagrees with this plan. First, she argues that afternoons are not ideal because many students are studying or reading, and loud music would be distracting. She suggests evenings would be better for relaxation. Second, she believes the lawn is an unsuitable location since large crowds would trample the grass, eventually turning the area to mud and ruining its improved condition. Therefore, she feels the proposal needs reconsideration.
