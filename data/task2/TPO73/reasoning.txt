For this task, I must first summarize the proposal from the reading, which is a student's letter suggesting free afternoon jazz concerts on the lawn near the student center. Then, I need to state the female student's opinion from the listening—she disagrees with the proposal—and explain her two reasons: 1) afternoon concerts would be distracting to students studying, and 2) the lawn would get damaged by crowds. My response must directly address the question by covering these points concisely, using only the provided information, and fitting within 100–120 words for a natural 60-second speech.
