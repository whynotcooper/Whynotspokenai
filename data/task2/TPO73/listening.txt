Now, listen to two students discussing the letter What did you think of Tim's letter I don't know It's a nice idea, but I don't think he's thought it through I mean he's not thinking about the problems it'll create like what Well like first of all I don't think that's really the best time of day to do it really a lot of students don't have to just sit around and relaxre studying and reading getting stuff done for their classes so it'd be really distracting with loud music playing in the background I guess that's true maybe in the evenings it'd be a way to help people relax after a long day of studying that might make more sense Also I think it ought to be indoors somewhere that area around the student center looks really nice now but that would change fast if a bunch of students started hanging out there a lot really you think so Sure because think about it the audience is gonna to be walking all over it normally there aren't a lot of people on the lawn but when you've got a crowd like that gathered for a show the grass gets trampled and it dies eventually the area would turn to mud.
