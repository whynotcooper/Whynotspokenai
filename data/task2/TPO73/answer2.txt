In the letter, a student recommends organizing free jazz concerts in the afternoons on the lawn by the student center to offer live music for relaxation. The woman opposes this proposal for two main reasons. Initially, she points out that afternoons are often used for academic work, so music could disrupt studying; evenings might be more appropriate. Additionally, she contends that holding events on the lawn would damage the grass due to heavy foot traffic from audiences, leading to erosion and mud, which would spoil the recently enhanced area. Thus, she thinks the idea is not well thought out.
