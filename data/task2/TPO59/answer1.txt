The reading announces a new policy allowing undergraduates to take graduate courses and apply those credits toward a future graduate degree at Western University, aiming to encourage them to take these courses and later enroll there. However, the male student in the conversation strongly disagrees with this change. He provides two key reasons for his opposition. First, he argues that it will negatively affect current graduate students because graduate seminars rely on small class sizes for effective discussion and individual attention, which would be lost with an influx of undergraduates. Second, he believes it is detrimental to the undergraduates themselves, as graduate school is traditionally a time to broaden horizons by attending a different university, meeting new people, and learning from different professors, an opportunity they would miss by staying at Western.
