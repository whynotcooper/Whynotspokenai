For this Integrated Speaking Task, I will first summarize the reading's new policy, which allows undergraduates to apply graduate course credits toward a future graduate degree at Western University. Then, I will state the male student's clear disagreement from the listening. The question asks me to explain why he disagrees, so I will focus on detailing his two main reasons: 1) the negative impact on graduate students due to larger class sizes reducing discussion quality and individual attention, and 2) the disadvantage for undergraduates who miss the opportunity to broaden their horizons by attending a different university for graduate school. My response must accurately connect these reasons to his overall stance without adding or omitting any details from the provided materials.
