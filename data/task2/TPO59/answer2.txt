According to the reading, Western University is implementing a policy where undergraduates can receive credit for graduate-level courses that count toward both their undergraduate and potential future graduate degrees at the same institution. The male student expresses clear disagreement with this policy. His first reason is that it harms graduate students by increasing class sizes in seminars, which are meant to be small to foster quality discussions and provide individual attention—benefits that would diminish. Additionally, he contends that it is bad for undergraduates because they typically attend a different university for graduate school to widen their horizons, meet new people, and experience different academic environments, opportunities they would forgo if they remained at Western.
