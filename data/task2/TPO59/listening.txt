now listen to a conversation between two graduate students about the policy change i overheard you complaining about that new policy yesterday jim that's right i think it'll actually be bad for the undergrads and it's definitely going to be bad for us graduate students why should grad students care look grad school is about seminars small seminars with just a few students right and there's a reason for that you need small classes to get good discussions and individual attention put too many people in well it's good by to all that plus you know these undergrads are smart they've got the grades but they aren't always prepared in terms of prior coursework that can slow things down for us okay and you were saying it's bad from their standpoint too right look you did your undergraduate work at another university and so did i and that's pretty typical in general you do your undergraduate studies at one university and you go somewhere else for graduate school grad school is an opportunity to widen your horizons meet new people different professors maybe live in a new place if undergrads stay on they won't get thatthe man disagrees with the new policy explain why
