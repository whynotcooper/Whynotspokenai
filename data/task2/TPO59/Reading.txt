NewCourse Credit Policy
 Western University allows undergraduate students with a high grade average to take
 courses in our graduate school programs. Until now, these students received course
 credit toward their undergraduate degrees. Beginning next year, however,
 undergraduates taking graduate‐level courses will not only receive credit toward
 their undergraduate degrees: if they go on to enroll as graduate students at Western,
 they can also apply these credits toward a graduate degree. This new policy will
 encourage our best undergraduates to take advantage of our graduate course
 offerings while they are undergraduates and also to make Western University their
 first choice for graduate school later on.
 Sincerely, Robert Steele
