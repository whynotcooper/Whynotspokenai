The reading proposes a student-run snack shop to create job opportunities and provide convenient on-campus food access. The man in the conversation fully supports this idea. He gives two reasons for his agreement. First, he believes these jobs offer invaluable real-world business experience. Students would learn practical skills like creating staff schedules, managing inventory, and ordering supplies—knowledge directly applicable to future careers, especially for aspiring entrepreneurs. Second, he argues the shop solves a genuine convenience problem. While the cafeteria is nice, its long lines are time-consuming, and off-campus stores require a lengthy round trip. A campus snack shop would save students significant time, allowing them to focus more on their studies instead.
