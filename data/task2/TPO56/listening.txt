now listen to two students discussing the letter did you see julia's letter yeah i did and i'm all for it yeah yeah jobs like that provide students with great work experience experience they can use in the real world like what well i mean basically they'd be running a business they learn how to do it all make up staff schedules keep track of inventory order supplies make sure the building is maintained yeah i guess you could learn a lot yeah stuff you can really use when you graduate especially if you're thinking of starting your own business okay yeah i can see that but her second point doesn't make a lot of sense to me i mean we have a nice cafeteria what's wrong with eating there well it is a nice cafeteria but sometimes the lines are really long and you just don't have time to wait yeah that's true especially if all you want is like a cup of coffee or a quick sandwich or something that's true but if you have a car yeah if you have a car which a lot of students don't you can drive to one of the stores in town but still the closest ones like a fifteen minute drive so round trip it takes at least a half an hour and that's time you could use for studying exactly the man expresses his opinion about the letter writer's proposal briefly summarize the proposal then state the man's opinion and explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion
