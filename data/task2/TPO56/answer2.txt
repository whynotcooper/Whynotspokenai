According to the reading, a student-operated snack shop is suggested to generate employment and offer a handy place for snacks on campus. The male student expresses his strong agreement with this proposal. His first reason is that working there provides excellent practical experience. He mentions students would learn to run a business by handling schedules, inventory, and supplies—skills valuable after graduation, particularly for starting one's own business. His second reason addresses convenience: the cafeteria often has long waits, and traveling to town stores takes at least thirty minutes round trip. Therefore, a campus shop would save precious time that students could better use for academic purposes like studying.
