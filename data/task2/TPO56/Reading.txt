Students Need Campus Snack Shop
 I think the university should open a snack shop on campus-a snack shop that would
 be operated entirely by our students. A student- run snack shop would benefit
 students in two ways. First, it would create a number of job opportunities for
 students Second, the store would be a convenient place on campus to buy food,
 providing students with a fast； easy place to get snacks at any time of the day
