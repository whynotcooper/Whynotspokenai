For this Integrated Speaking Task, I will first summarize the reading's proposal for a student-run snack shop, highlighting its two stated benefits: creating student job opportunities and providing convenient on-campus food access. Next, I will clearly state the male student's opinion from the listening, which is that he agrees with the proposal. Then, I will explain his two supporting reasons: 1) The jobs provide valuable real-world business experience like scheduling and inventory management, useful for future careers or entrepreneurship. 2) The snack shop addresses the cafeteria's long lines and off-campus stores' inconvenience, saving students time for studying. My response will directly address the question by covering all these elements concisely within the word limit, using the sources accurately without adding or omitting information.
