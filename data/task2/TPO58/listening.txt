now listen to two students discussing the letter hey what do you think about this idea well it sounds great but i don't actually think it would work very well oh really yeah i mean i get what he's saying but i don't think he's thought about the problems with that kind of thing no now i'm worried about the books it'd be really easy to spill something on them accidentally and then they could get ruined and some of them are really expensive yeah even if people tried to be careful that would probably happen sometimes exactly and the other thing is we already have the convenience store in the student center which sells that same kind of stuff that's true and the student center is actually much closer to the academic buildings where classes are held the bookstores all the way on the other side of campus it's not close to the buildings where students are taking classes so i don't think students would really go there between classes the way he says the woman expresses her opinion about the proposal described in the letter briefly summarize the proposal then state her opinion about the proposal and explained the reason she gives for holding that opinion
