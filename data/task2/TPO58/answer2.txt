According to the proposal in the letter, the campus bookstore should offer snacks and beverages and provide tables and chairs for students to use while deciding on purchases or during breaks. The female student opposes this suggestion. Her first reason is the risk of accidental spills damaging expensive books. Additionally, she argues that a convenience store in the student center already sells snacks and drinks and is much more conveniently located near where classes are held. Therefore, students probably wouldn't visit the faraway bookstore just for a quick snack, making the proposal impractical.
