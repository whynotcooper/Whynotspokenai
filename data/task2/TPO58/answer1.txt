The reading proposes that the campus bookstore start selling snacks and drinks, adding seating so students can eat while browsing or between classes. However, the woman in the conversation disagrees with this idea. She gives two main reasons for her opinion. First, she is concerned about books being damaged; it would be easy for someone to accidentally spill a drink on the books, ruining them, and some textbooks are quite expensive. Second, she points out that there's already a convenience store in the student center selling similar items. Since the student center is closer to academic buildings, students are unlikely to go out of their way to the distant bookstore between classes.
