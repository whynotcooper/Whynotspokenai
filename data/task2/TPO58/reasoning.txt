For this Integrated Speaking Task, I will first summarize the proposal from the reading, which suggests the campus bookstore should sell snacks and drinks and provide seating for students to consume them while browsing or between classes. Then, I will clearly state the female student's opinion from the listening, which is that she disagrees with the proposal. I will explain her two reasons: first, the risk of spilling and damaging expensive books, and second, the existing convenience store in the student center is more conveniently located near academic buildings, making the bookstore an impractical choice for between-class snacks. My response will directly address the question by covering all these elements concisely, ensuring it stays within 100–120 words and uses natural speech patterns without adding or omitting details.
