Campus Bookstore Should Sell Snacks and Drinks
 In addition to selling books and textbooks, I think the campus bookstore
 should also offer drinks and snacks for sale. The bookstore could have a
 few chairs and tables available where students could sit and have a snack
 or something to drink, while the/re looking through books and deciding
 what to buy. It would also be convenient for students who got hungry
 between classes, and wanted to grab something to eat before going to
 their next class
