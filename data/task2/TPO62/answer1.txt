The university is considering building a new parking lot, and a student letter proposed using Sanders Field, arguing it's unused since the new stadium was built and would provide needed parking for students. However, the woman in the conversation disagrees with this proposal. She gives two reasons for her opposition. First, she states that Sanders Field is not wasted space but is frequently used by students for relaxing, studying, and socializing, serving as a valuable open area on campus. Second, she argues that the parking need is exaggerated, noting that existing dorm parking lots are never full, and commuters would find Sanders Field inconvenient due to its distance from classroom buildings, making it a poor location choice.
