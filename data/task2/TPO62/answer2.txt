According to the reading, a student suggests converting Sanders Field into a parking lot, claiming it's unused and would address parking shortages for on- and off-campus students. The woman opposes this idea. Her first reason is that the field is actually useful; students utilize it for activities like studying outdoors or napping, and it provides a rare open space on campus. Secondly, she disputes the parking necessity, pointing out that dorm lots are underutilized and that Sanders Field is too far from academic buildings, making it impractical for commuters who prefer closer parking. Thus, she believes the proposal is misguided.
