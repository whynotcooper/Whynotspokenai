For this Integrated Speaking Task, I will first summarize the reading's proposal to build a new parking lot at Sanders Field, as suggested by a student letter. Then, I will clearly state the woman's opinion from the listening—that she disagrees with this proposal. Finally, I will explain her two main reasons for opposition: first, that Sanders Field is actively used by students for relaxation and study, making it a valuable open space, and second, that the parking need is overstated, as dorm lots are underused and the field's location is inconvenient for commuters. My responses will directly address the question by covering the proposal and the woman's opposing reasons, ensuring accuracy and completeness within the word limit.
