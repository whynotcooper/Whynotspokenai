 NewParking Lot Location
 I was very pleased to read about the university's plans to build a new parking lot to
 accommodate the growing number of student cars on campus. Since the location for
 the newlot has not yet been determined, I would like to suggest that Sanders Field
 be used. Sanders Field has not been used for sports events since the new stadium
 was built two years ago. Right now: it is wasted space：soitwouldbeanidealareato
 turn into something useful like a parking lot. Students who live in the dorms really
 need a place to park their cars Students living off campus could really use the extra
 parking, too
