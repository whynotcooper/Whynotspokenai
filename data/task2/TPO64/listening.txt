now listen to two students discussing the article in the newspaper i don't like the university's plan really why not well even though we won't have to leave the library that's just the problem nobody's going to feel like walking all the way over to the cafeteria especially when the weather's bad they'll just run down to the basement to eat i don't understand isn't that a good thing no because in the library they're just going to serve a bunch of unhealthy snacks sandwiches and sweets and soda so students will just eat junk at least the cafeteria has some healthy food okay i see what you mean yeah i probably wouldn't walk over to the cafeteria either and i think they're wrong about another thing if i'm in the library and i know my friends are down in the basement chatting i'm going to be tempted to go down there and hang out with them you know what i mean i'm sure i'm not the only one who'd be tempted to go down there and chat how's anybody going to concentrate on doing actual work yeah good point this whole thing might backfire the woman expresses her opinion of the university's plan describe her opinion and her reasons for holding that opinion
