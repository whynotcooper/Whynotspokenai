For this Integrated Speaking Task, I will first summarize the university's plan from the reading: to build a cafe in the library basement for convenience and productivity. Then, I will clearly state the female student's opinion from the listening: she opposes the plan. I must explain her two main reasons: 1) the cafe will only serve unhealthy snacks, discouraging students from walking to the cafeteria for healthier options, and 2) it will create distractions as students might socialize in the cafe instead of studying. My response will directly address the question by describing her opinion and reasons, ensuring all information comes directly from the sources without adding, omitting, or distorting details. I will structure two answers that are concise (100–120 words), use natural speech patterns, and include transitions for coherence.
