According to the reading, the university intends to construct a cafe in the library's basement to address student complaints about leaving for meals and to boost productivity through brief breaks. In contrast, the female student opposes this plan. She believes it will lead to poor dietary choices because the cafe will serve unhealthy items, making students less inclined to visit the cafeteria for nutritious options. Additionally, she is concerned that the cafe will distract students; knowing friends are socializing there might lure them away from studying, undermining the library's purpose. Thus, she feels the plan could backfire by harming both health and academic focus.
