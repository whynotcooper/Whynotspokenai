The university plans to build a cafe in the library basement to provide convenient food access and enhance study productivity by allowing short breaks. However, the woman strongly disagrees with this proposal. Her first reason is that the cafe will likely offer only unhealthy snacks like sandwiches, sweets, and soda. Since students won't want to leave the library, especially in bad weather, they'll opt for these junk foods instead of walking to the cafeteria for healthier meals. Secondly, she argues that the cafe could become a social hub, tempting students to chat with friends rather than focus on their work, ultimately reducing concentration and productivity in the library.
