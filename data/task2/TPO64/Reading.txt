 Cafe to be Built in Library
 The university has decided to build a cafe in the basement of the library. The reason
 given for this new development is that university officials believe students will enjoy the
 convenience of being able to eat without having to leave the library. Students have often
 complained that their studies are disrupted because they must leave the library
 whenever they want to eat. Officials also believe that it will help make library study more
 productive if students have the opportunity to take short breaks in the cafe while they're
 working
 Sincerely,
