I will first identify the main topic as the two types of protective resemblance in animals, specifically contrasting fixed versus adaptive strategies. The question explicitly asks to "explain the differences," so I will structure the response to highlight this contrast. For organization, I will start with the main idea, then describe the first type (fixed resemblance) with the horned frog example, followed by the second type (adaptive resemblance) with the lizard example. Each point will include how the animal's movement or environment permanence determines its strategy, using specific details from the lecture like color, shape, and pigment changes. I will ensure both answers are concise, avoid repetition, and use cohesive transitions like "in contrast" or "on the other hand" to emphasize differences naturally within the word limit.
