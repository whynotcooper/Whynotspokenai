The professor discusses two types of protective resemblance based on whether an animal's environment is permanent or changing. The first type is fixed resemblance, seen in the horned frog, which lives in one stable environment. This frog is brown with lines like dead leaves on the forest floor, making it hard for predators to detect, and its appearance doesn't change. In contrast, the second type is adaptive resemblance, demonstrated by the anole lizard. Since it moves through different environments, it can change color using special pigments in its cells. For instance, it turns brown among dead leaves but green in shrubs, allowing it to blend in dynamically as needed for survival.
