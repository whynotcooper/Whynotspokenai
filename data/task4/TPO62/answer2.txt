The lecture explains two distinct protective resemblance strategies in animals. One is fixed, where animals like the horned frog have a permanent appearance matching their unchanging habitat; for example, its brown color and vein-like lines mimic forest floor leaves, providing constant camouflage. On the other hand, adaptive resemblance involves color change for animals in varying environments, such as the anole lizard. This lizard adjusts its color via movable pigments—turning brown in leafy areas or green near shrubs—to blend in wherever it goes. Thus, the key difference lies in whether the camouflage is static or flexible based on environmental mobility.
