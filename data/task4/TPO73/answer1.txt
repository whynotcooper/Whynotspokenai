The professor discusses two strategies to help teachers ensure students follow classroom rules. The first approach is explaining the purpose behind rules. For instance, when prohibiting snacks in class, the teacher clarified this was to maintain cleanliness, prevent spills from damaging materials, and avoid attracting insects. Understanding these reasons increased student compliance. The second method involves obtaining student commitment. Using the same no-snack rule, the teacher created a poster listing the rule and had each child sign it as a personal pledge. Displaying this signed poster served as a constant reminder of their promise, which effectively encouraged adherence to the rule.
