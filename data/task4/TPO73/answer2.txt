According to the lecture, teachers can employ two effective strategies to promote rule-following among students. One technique is providing clear explanations for rules. The professor illustrated this with her no-food policy, justifying it by explaining how spills create messes, damage property, and attract pests. This rationale helped students understand and accept the rule. Another effective strategy is securing a formal commitment from students. She demonstrated this by having her class sign a poster that stated the no-eating rule, creating a visual contract. This public commitment reinforced their personal responsibility and significantly improved rule compliance throughout the school year.
