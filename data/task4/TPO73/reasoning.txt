I will first identify the lecture's main topic: two strategies teachers can use to ensure students follow classroom rules. The two key points are clearly stated: 1) explaining the purpose of rules, and 2) having students make a commitment to follow rules. For each point, I'll include the professor's classroom example. My organization will follow this pattern: state the main topic → describe first strategy with example → describe second strategy with example. I'll ensure both answers directly address the question's instruction to "explain two strategies," stay within 100-120 words, use cohesive transitions, and maintain an academic yet conversational tone suitable for oral delivery.
