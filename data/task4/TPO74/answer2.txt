According to the lecture, adopting environmentally friendly practices offers businesses two major advantages. One way is through cost savings on operations. The example given is a coffee shop that installed energy-saving light bulbs, leading to a notable decrease in their electricity expenses. Another benefit is enhanced attractiveness to consumers. The coffee shop also switched to recycled paper products for items like napkins and cups. They promoted this change in their advertising, which successfully drew in environmentally conscious customers, boosting their patronage. In summary, these approaches help companies save money while also expanding their customer base.
