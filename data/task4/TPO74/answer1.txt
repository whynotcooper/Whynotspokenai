The professor explains that environmentally friendly business practices benefit companies in two key ways. First, they can significantly reduce operating costs. For instance, a local coffee shop replaced its regular light bulbs with energy-efficient ones, which used less electricity and lasted longer, thereby saving a substantial amount on their monthly energy bills. Second, these practices make a business more appealing to a specific consumer base. The same coffee shop began using napkins and cups made from recycled paper. By advertising this eco-friendly initiative, they attracted more customers who value environmental protection, which increased their sales. Thus, both strategies provide clear financial and marketing advantages.
