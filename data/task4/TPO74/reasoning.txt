The question asks me to describe two ways environmentally friendly practices benefit businesses, using points and examples from the lecture. I will first identify the main topic: the dual benefits of eco-friendly practices for both the environment and businesses. The lecture clearly outlines two key benefits: cost savings and increased consumer appeal. For each benefit, a specific example from the coffee shop is provided. My response will be organized as follows: 1) State the main idea that these practices help businesses. 2) Explain the first benefit (cost reduction) with its example (energy-efficient bulbs lowering electricity bills). 3) Explain the second benefit (consumer attraction) with its example (using recycled paper products to draw environmentally conscious customers). I will ensure the summary is concise, uses transition words for flow, and stays within the word limit by focusing only on the lecture's content.
