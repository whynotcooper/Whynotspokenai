According to the lecture, certain tree-dwelling mammals use specialized techniques to navigate the canopy and avoid ground predators. One approach is gliding, exemplified by the lemur, which possesses wing-like skin flaps. By stretching its legs during a jump, it can glide through the air to another tree. Alternatively, some mammals employ physical strength. The orangutan, for example, wraps itself around a tree trunk and sways forcefully. This motion bends the tree closer to an adjacent one, creating a bridge so it can cross. Both strategies enable these animals to remain in the treetops, where they find food and stay safe.
