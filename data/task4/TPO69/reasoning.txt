The question asks how two specific mammals, the lemur and orangutan, are able to live primarily in the treetops. The lecture’s main topic is the adaptation of non-flying mammals for arboreal life, focusing on two distinct strategies: gliding and using physical force. I will structure the response by first stating the main idea—that these mammals have developed specialized methods to move between trees without descending. Then, I will summarize each strategy with its corresponding example: the lemur’s gliding adaptation using skin flaps, and the orangutan’s method of swaying trees to bridge gaps. The summary will be concise, use cohesive transitions, and strictly follow the word limit to sound natural for a 60-second oral response.
