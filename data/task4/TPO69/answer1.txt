The professor explains that some mammals have developed unique adaptations to live in the rainforest canopy without descending to the ground. The first strategy involves gliding. For instance, the lemur has flaps of skin between its limbs that function like wings. When it jumps, these flaps catch the air, enabling it to glide from one tree to another safely. The second method relies on physical force. The orangutan, a large ape, uses its body weight to sway trees. By rocking back and forth, it bends the tree toward another, allowing it to reach across and access food. These methods help both species avoid predators and find resources while staying above the forest floor.
