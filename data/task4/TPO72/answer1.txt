The professor explains that young animals develop temporary physical traits for survival. The first feature is camouflage, which helps them blend into their environment to avoid predators. For instance, baby lions are born with spotted fur that matches the African grasslands, making them difficult to spot while they're still immobile. The second feature involves specialized structures for efficient movement to escape danger. The lecture gives the example of certain water birds that can't fly yet; they have a finger-like claw on their wings, allowing them to climb trees for safety. Both features disappear as the animals mature and develop other survival methods.
