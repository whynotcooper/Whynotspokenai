According to the lecture, juvenile animals possess transient physical characteristics that enhance their survival. One protective feature is camouflage, enabling them to remain concealed from predators. Baby lions exemplify this with their spotted coats, which provide effective concealment in grassy habitats during their vulnerable early months. Another survival feature involves specialized appendages for mobility. For example, some young aquatic birds develop a temporary, finger-like projection on their wings, which they use to climb vegetation and evade threats before their flying capabilities fully develop. These temporary adaptations are eventually lost as the animals reach adulthood.
