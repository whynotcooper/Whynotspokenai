I will first identify the lecture's main topic: temporary physical features in young animals that aid survival. The question specifically asks for two features, so I will extract the two key points from the lecture: camouflage features and mobility-enhancing features. For each point, I will include the provided example (baby lions' spots for camouflage, and young water birds' wing claws for climbing). The summary will be organized logically: start with the main idea, then describe the first feature with its example, followed by the second feature with its example. I will ensure both answers directly address the question, stay within 100-120 words, use cohesive devices, and maintain natural spoken language flow while avoiding any personal opinions.
