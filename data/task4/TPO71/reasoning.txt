I will first identify the lecture's main topic as "two characteristics of effective feedback," directly addressing the question's framing. The two key points are: 1) proper timing (given while students can still apply it) with the art class painting example, and 2) focusing on work rather than the student with the color suggestion example. My organization will follow: main idea → first characteristic + example → second characteristic + example. I'll ensure both answers stay within 100-120 words for natural oral delivery, use cohesive transitions like "first" and "second," and maintain academic neutrality without personal additions. The responses will vary in sentence structure—one using more complex clauses, the other simpler phrasing—while preserving accuracy.
