According to the lecture, effective feedback has two main characteristics. The first is appropriate timing; it should be delivered when students are still working on a skill and have chances to use the advice. The art class example illustrates this—feedback on paintings is given while the class is still learning painting techniques. The second characteristic is that feedback targets the work, not the student. For example, if an art teacher dislikes the colors in a painting, she might suggest trying different colors next time rather than labeling the student a bad painter. This ensures students learn what to change without feeling discouraged.
