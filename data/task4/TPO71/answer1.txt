The professor discusses two key traits of effective feedback for students. First, it must be properly timed, meaning teachers provide it while learners are still engaged with the task and can apply the suggestions. For instance, an art teacher should give painting feedback during the unit so students can practice recommended techniques. Second, effective feedback focuses on the work itself rather than the student’s abilities. Using the same example, if colors in a painting seem off, the teacher should propose specific color alternatives for the next attempt instead of criticizing the student personally. This approach helps students understand how to improve future work.
