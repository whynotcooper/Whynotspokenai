The question asks to explain the *disadvantages* of decentralization for a company, using points and examples from the lecture. The lecture's main topic is the disadvantages of decentralization in large, multi-branch companies. It provides two clear disadvantages, each with a specific example. My strategy is to first state the main idea (decentralization has disadvantages), then summarize the first disadvantage with its example (local decisions harming the overall company, illustrated by the clothing store advertising vs. closing), and finally summarize the second disadvantage with its example (inconsistent policies causing customer unhappiness, illustrated by the store refusing returns). This creates a logical flow: main idea → point 1 + example → point 2 + example, directly addressing the task.
