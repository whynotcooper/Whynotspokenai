The professor explains that decentralization, where local branch managers make decisions, can have significant disadvantages for a large company. The first drawback is that local decisions can harm the overall company. For instance, a manager at a struggling clothing store might spend heavily on advertising to improve their branch, whereas the central office might instead close it to save money for more successful locations. A second disadvantage is inconsistent policy application, which can upset customers. Using the same company, if one store refuses to accept clothing returns while others do, customers at that store will likely be dissatisfied because the service isn't what they expect.
