According to the lecture, a major downside of decentralization in a multi-branch company is that it can lead to negative outcomes for the firm. One problem is that local managers may make choices beneficial only to their branch but detrimental to the corporation. The example given is a clothing company where a local manager could waste corporate funds on advertising a failing store, while headquarters would prefer to close it. Another issue is the lack of uniform policies. For example, if one store in the chain decides not to accept product returns, it will anger customers who are accustomed to that service at other locations, ultimately damaging customer relations.
