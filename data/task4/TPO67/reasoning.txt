I will first identify the main topic as the "paradox of technology," defined as new technology intended to simplify life instead making it more complicated. The question specifically asks to use the lecture's examples, so I will structure the response by stating the main idea, then summarizing the two key examples provided: the universal remote control and the small cell phone. For each, I will explain how the technology was meant to help but ended up creating new difficulties. The organization will be logical: main idea → first example with details → second example with details. I will ensure each response is concise (100–120 words), uses cohesive devices, and avoids personal opinions, while varying sentence structures between the two answers to demonstrate flexibility.
