The professor discusses the paradox of technology, where innovations designed to simplify tasks often complicate them. The first example is universal remote controls. They were created to replace multiple remotes for devices like TVs and DVD players, but programming them is difficult. Users spend hours with manuals and must remember complex button functions, making the process more frustrating. The second example is small cell phones. While their portability is convenient, the tiny buttons lead to frequent misdials because they are hard to press accurately. Thus, both cases show how technology can backfire, increasing rather than reducing hassle for people.
