In the lecture, the paradox of technology is explained as new inventions that aim to ease life but end up making it harder. For instance, universal remotes were developed to operate all electronic devices with one control. However, programming it requires reading manuals and memorizing functions, which adds complexity. Another case is miniature cell phones. Their small size makes them portable, but the reduced button size causes users to dial wrong numbers accidentally, as the buttons are too small for fingers. These examples illustrate that even well-intentioned technological advances can create unintended difficulties, contradicting their original purpose.
