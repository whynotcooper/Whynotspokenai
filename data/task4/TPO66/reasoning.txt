I will first identify the main topic as the two different hoarding strategies animals use. The lecture clearly contrasts centralized hoarding (one location) with dispersed hoarding (multiple locations). For each strategy, I will include both the defining characteristic and the provided example, while directly addressing the question's requirement to "explain two different hoarding strategies." My organization will follow: main topic introduction → first strategy with rationale and squirrel example → second strategy with rationale and desert rat example. I'll ensure both answers stay within 100-120 words, use natural spoken language, and maintain parallel structure while varying sentence patterns between versions.
