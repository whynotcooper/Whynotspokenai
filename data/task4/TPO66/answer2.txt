According to the lecture, animals employ different food hoarding strategies. One method is storing all food in one place, a strategy viable for creatures capable of defending that central stockpile. The professor gives the example of aggressive squirrels that hoard a big mound of pine cones and successfully chase away thieves. Conversely, the second strategy is dispersal, where food is divided and hidden in many separate locations. This protects the supply from being entirely stolen but requires a strong memory. As an example, a type of desert rat buries seeds in various spots in the sand and can remember the locations of hundreds of these caches.
