The professor describes two distinct hoarding strategies used by animals. The first is centralized hoarding, where food is stored in a single location. This approach works for animals strong enough to defend their supply. For instance, certain squirrels accumulate a large pile of pine cones under one tree and aggressively guard it from competitors. The second strategy is dispersed hoarding, which involves scattering food across many hiding spots. This method is used by animals that cannot physically defend a central cache. The professor illustrates this with a desert rat species that buries seeds in numerous locations and relies on its excellent memory to later recover hundreds of these hidden caches.
