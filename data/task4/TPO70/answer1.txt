The professor discusses two types of protective resemblance in animals. The first is fixed resemblance, where an animal’s appearance permanently matches one environment. For instance, the horned frog lives entirely on the forest floor, so its brown color and leaf-like veins blend with dead leaves, making it nearly invisible to predators. The second type is adaptive resemblance, where animals change their appearance to suit different environments. The anole lizard, for example, has special pigments that shift color based on its surroundings—turning brown among leaves or green in shrubs. The key difference is that fixed resemblance is permanent, while adaptive resemblance changes dynamically.
