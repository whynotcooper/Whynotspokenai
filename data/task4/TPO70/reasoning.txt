I will first identify the main topic from the lecture: two types of protective resemblance in animals (fixed vs. adaptive). The question asks to "explain the differences between the two types" using the horned frog and anole lizard examples. I will structure each answer as:  
1. State the main idea (two types of protective resemblance).  
2. Describe the first type (fixed resemblance) with the horned frog example.  
3. Describe the second type (adaptive resemblance) with the anole lizard example.  
4. Emphasize the key difference (static vs. changing environments).  
I will ensure both answers are distinct in phrasing and sentence structure while staying within 100–120 words and avoiding personal opinions.
