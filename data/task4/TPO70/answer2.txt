In the lecture, the professor contrasts two forms of protective resemblance. One is a static strategy, seen in the horned frog, which inhabits a single environment. Its body is permanently colored and shaped like forest-floor leaves, providing constant camouflage. The other is a dynamic strategy, exemplified by the anole lizard. This species moves through varied habitats and adapts its color using mobile pigments—brown on the ground or green in foliage. Thus, the core distinction lies in whether the camouflage is unchanging for a stable habitat or flexible for shifting environments.
