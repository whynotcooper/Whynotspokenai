I will first identify the lecture's main topic, which is the formation of emotional bonds between infants and caregivers, specifically challenging the old belief that feeding is the primary factor. The two key points are: 1) the historical belief that feeding creates attachment, and 2) the modern understanding that physical comfort/touch is more important, demonstrated through the monkey experiment. I will organize the summary by stating the main topic, then explaining each point with its corresponding example from the experiment (wire mother for feeding, cloth mother for comfort), ensuring direct address of what psychologists learned. The responses will use cohesive devices like "while," "however," and "regardless" to connect ideas naturally within the word limit.
