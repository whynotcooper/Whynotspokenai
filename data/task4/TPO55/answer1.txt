The lecture explains how psychologists' understanding of infant-caregiver bonding has evolved. Initially, they believed feeding was the key factor, since infants depend on others for nourishment. However, research now shows that physical comfort is more crucial. This was demonstrated in an experiment with baby monkeys who had two artificial mothers: a wire one that provided food and a soft, cloth-covered one. Despite which mother fed them, all monkeys spent most of their time clinging to the cloth mother for comfort, especially when frightened. Thus, psychologists learned that touch, not just feeding, forms strong emotional bonds.
