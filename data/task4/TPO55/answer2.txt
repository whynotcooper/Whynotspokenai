Psychologists have revised their view on how infants form attachments to caregivers. While it was once thought that feeding created these bonds, studies indicate comforting touch is actually more significant. In a famous experiment, baby monkeys were given a choice between a wire mother that supplied milk and a soft, cloth mother. Regardless of which one provided food, the monkeys consistently preferred the cloth mother, seeking it for security and cuddling. This shows that emotional connections develop primarily through physical comfort, not merely from receiving nourishment.
