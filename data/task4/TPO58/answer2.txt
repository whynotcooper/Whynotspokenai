According to the lecture, consumers reduce perceived purchasing risk through two main methods. One approach is doing comprehensive research before buying. The example given is someone considering a computer purchase who reads online reviews and seeks opinions from multiple owners to feel more confident in their decision. Another strategy is staying loyal to a specific brand based on past positive experiences. For instance, a family that had a reliable car from a certain manufacturer will likely return to that company for their next vehicle, believing they will have another good experience, thereby lowering their sense of risk.
