The professor explains that consumers employ specific strategies to minimize the feeling of risk when making significant purchases. First, they conduct thorough research to gather extensive information from multiple sources. For instance, when buying a computer, a person might read expert reviews and listen to other users' opinions to feel more secure about their choice. Second, consumers maintain loyalty to a trusted brand. For example, if a family has a positive experience with a car from a particular company, they are likely to purchase from that same brand again for their next car, trusting it will lead to another satisfactory outcome.
