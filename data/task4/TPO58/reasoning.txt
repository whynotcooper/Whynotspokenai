First, I will identify the main topic: the two strategies consumers use to reduce perceived risk in purchasing decisions. The lecture clearly outlines these as 1) thorough research and 2) brand loyalty. For each point, I will summarize the strategy and include the provided example. My organization will follow this structure: state the main idea (consumers use strategies to reduce risk), then explain the first strategy with its example, followed by the second strategy with its example. I will ensure both answers directly address the question by explicitly naming the two ways and linking them to risk reduction. The responses will be kept within 100-120 words using cohesive transitions like "first," "for example," "second," and "another strategy" while maintaining oral fluency.
