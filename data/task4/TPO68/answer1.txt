The professor discusses two methods people use to explain inappropriate behavior to avoid negative judgments. First, excuses involve attributing behavior to external, uncontrollable factors. For instance, a student might be late for class because their alarm clock failed, implying they didn’t intend to oversleep. Second, justifications acknowledge the action was intentional but argue it was acceptable due to a valid reason. The example given is a student missing class to attend a crucial job interview, justifying the absence as necessary. Both strategies help preserve one’s image by providing context for behavior that might otherwise seem irresponsible.
