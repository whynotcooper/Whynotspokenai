In the lecture, the professor explains how people account for inappropriate conduct through two approaches. One way is making excuses, where individuals blame circumstances beyond their control. For example, a student arriving late might cite a malfunctioning alarm clock, showing the delay wasn’t purposeful. Another method is offering justifications, where someone admits to acting intentionally but cites a good cause. As illustrated, a student could skip class for an important job interview, defending it as a reasonable choice. These tactics allow people to mitigate negative perceptions by clarifying their actions.
