First, I will identify the lecture's main topic: two strategies people use to account for inappropriate behavior to maintain a positive social image. The two key points are excuses and justifications, each with a clear example from the lecture. For organization, I will start by stating the main idea, then describe the first strategy (excuses) with its example (alarm clock failure causing lateness), followed by the second strategy (justifications) with its example (missing class for a job interview). This ensures a logical flow from general to specific, directly addressing the question's requirement to "explain two ways." I will keep responses concise, using varied sentence structures and cohesive devices like "first" and "second" or "one way" and "another way" across answers, while avoiding opinions and sticking to lecture content.
