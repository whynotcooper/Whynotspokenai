Listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class generally, of course, we want other people to think well of us we want others to see us as good people as people who know how to behave appropriately but being human we all occasionally behave inappropriately do something we shouldn't do and when that happens we often come up with explanations for our inappropriate behavior so that others won't think were foolish or rude or irresponsible Let's look at a couple different ways people explain or account for inappropriate behavior one way to account for inappropriate behavior is to attribute it to something beyond our control this type of explanation is called an excuse with excuses we acknowledge that our behavior was inappropriate but claim that we didn't intend to behave that way that our inappropriate behavior was due to events or circumstances beyond our control as a professor I hear excuses all the time for example when students are late to class a classic excuses that they overslept because their alarm clock didn't go off they didn't mean to come to class late, but something beyond their control went wrong with their alarm clock and that's why they didn't wake up on time and were late Another way we sometimes explain inappropriate behavior so that others don't think badly of us is by utilizing what's called a justification when we use a justification, we explain that we intentionally did something that would normally be inappropriate but that it was okay this time because we had a good reason for behaving the way we did I also often hear justifications when students explain why they missed a class for example, they say they missed the class because they had a very important job interview at the same time as the class so they chose to miss the class but they justify it by explaining that they had to go to an important job interview.
