According to the lecture, forest fires play a beneficial role in maintaining healthy forest ecosystems. One key advantage is that they facilitate plant reproduction. The professor illustrates this with pine trees, whose cones only open and release seeds when fire melts the sticky resin sealing them. Furthermore, fires enhance the habitat by altering the forest structure. For instance, by eliminating some trees, fires open up the canopy, allowing sunlight to stimulate the growth of new vegetation like grasses. This new plant life subsequently supports a greater diversity of wildlife, demonstrating how fires can revitalize the entire ecosystem.
