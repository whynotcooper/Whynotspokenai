The professor explains that forest fires, contrary to common belief, provide crucial benefits to forest ecosystems. First, fires are essential for the reproduction of certain tree species. For example, pine trees require fire because the heat melts the resin that holds their pine cones closed. This process releases the seeds onto the ground, allowing a new generation of trees to grow. Second, fires improve habitat quality for wildlife. They reduce tree density, which lets more sunlight reach the forest floor. This sunlight then encourages the growth of new shrubs and grasses, which in turn attracts new animal species to the area, creating a richer ecosystem.
