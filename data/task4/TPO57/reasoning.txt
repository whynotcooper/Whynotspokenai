The question asks to use the two examples from the talk to explain how a business can increase sales by creating a second interest. The lecture clearly outlines two distinct ways this strategy works: generating immediate sales and retaining customers for future sales. My response will first state the main concept of a "second interest" as a marketing strategy. Then, I will logically present the first point (immediate sales) with its corresponding computer/video game example, followed by the second point (customer retention) with its computer lessons example. I will ensure each answer directly addresses the "how" by linking the free bonus to the psychological incentive for an immediate purchase and the recurring free service to fostering long-term customer loyalty and repeat business. The responses will be structured for a 60-second delivery, using cohesive transitions and varying sentence structures between the two versions.
