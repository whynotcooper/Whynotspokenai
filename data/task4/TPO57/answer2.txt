According to the lecture, businesses can boost sales by employing a "second interest," which involves providing a free bonus. One method is to secure an immediate purchase. The example given is a computer retailer offering a complimentary video game with a computer. This free item acts as a decisive factor, encouraging a customer who is on the fence to complete the sale. The other method focuses on long-term customer retention to drive future sales. For example, the same store could provide monthly free computer lessons. This strategy ensures customers frequently visit the store, fostering a ongoing relationship. As a result, when these loyal customers need subsequent products, they are predisposed to make those purchases from the familiar store, thereby increasing overall sales.
