The professor explains that a "second interest" is a marketing strategy where a free product or service is offered to increase sales. This works in two primary ways. First, it can generate an immediate sale by convincing undecided customers. For instance, a computer store might offer a free video game with the purchase of a new computer. The bonus game provides an extra incentive, persuading a hesitant shopper to buy the computer right away. Second, a second interest helps retain customers for future purchases. The professor illustrates this with a computer store offering free, regular computer lessons. This service keeps customers returning to the store, maintaining contact. Consequently, when these customers later need other items, like a printer, they are more likely to buy them from that same store.
