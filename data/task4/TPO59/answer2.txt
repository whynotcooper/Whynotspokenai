The lecture presents two scientific theories explaining the extinction of dinosaurs. One theory centers on a lack of food. According to this view, an asteroid collision filled the atmosphere with dust, blocking sunlight. Without sun, plants could not produce food and died out. This collapse of the plant population led to the starvation of herbivorous dinosaurs and, subsequently, the carnivores that fed on them. The other theory focuses on global warming. Here, volcanic emissions trapped heat via carbon monoxide, raising Earth's temperature. This heat altered the gender ratio of dinosaur offspring, since warmer eggs yield more males. With fewer females being born, reproduction declined drastically, culminating in extinction.
