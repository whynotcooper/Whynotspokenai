The professor discusses two theories for the dinosaurs' extinction. The first is the food shortage theory. It proposes that an asteroid impact created a dust cloud that blocked sunlight. This prevented plants from photosynthesizing, causing them to die. Consequently, plant-eating dinosaurs starved, followed by the meat-eaters that preyed on them, leading to mass extinction. The second theory involves global warming. Massive volcanic eruptions released carbon monoxide, which trapped heat in the atmosphere, significantly raising temperatures. This affected dinosaurs because, as reptiles, the sex of their offspring is temperature-dependent. Warmer eggs produced more males, resulting in fewer females. This gender imbalance reduced reproduction rates, eventually causing their extinction.
