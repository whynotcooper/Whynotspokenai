The lecture discusses two physical adaptations that help certain animals achieve high running speeds. The first adaptation is specially adapted feet. For instance, the cheetah has extremely tough pads on the bottom of its feet. These pads are crucial because they protect the animal's feet from injury when running over rough, hot terrain like the African desert, allowing it to maintain high speeds without slowing down. The second adaptation involves specially adapted legs. Again, the cheetah serves as an example; it possesses long, muscular back legs. These powerful limbs enable the cheetah to push off with great force, propelling its body forward quickly, and their length allows it to cover more ground with each stride, contributing to its remarkable speed.
