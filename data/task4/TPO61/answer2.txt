According to the lecture, animals develop specific physical traits to run very fast. One key adaptation is having specially designed feet. The professor uses the cheetah as an example, explaining that it has tough foot pads. These pads are essential for running over the rough and hot ground of its habitat, as they prevent injuries and let the cheetah chase prey at top speed. Another important adaptation is having specially adapted legs. The cheetah also demonstrates this with its long and powerful back legs. These legs provide a strong push for acceleration and, due to their length, allow the animal to take massive strides, covering distance more efficiently and thus achieving high velocity.
