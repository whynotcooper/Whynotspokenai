I will first identify the lecture's main topic: physical adaptations that enable animals to run at high speeds. The question explicitly asks for two adaptations, so I will focus on the two key points discussed: specially adapted feet and specially adapted legs. For each point, I will summarize the explanation and include the provided example (cheetah's tough foot pads for the first point; cheetah's long, powerful back legs for the second). My organization will be: 1) State the main idea, 2) Describe the first adaptation with its example, 3) Describe the second adaptation with its example. I will ensure each response is 100–120 words, uses cohesive devices, and directly answers the prompt without adding personal opinions.
