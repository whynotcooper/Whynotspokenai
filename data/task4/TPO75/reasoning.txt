I will first identify the lecture's main topic: the importance of roosting for bat survival. The professor clearly outlines two key benefits: enabling flight and providing protection from predators. For each point, I will summarize the supporting example from the lecture. The first response will use a cause-effect structure, starting with the flight limitation and explaining how roosting solves it. The second response will use a problem-solution structure, first stating the predator threat and then showing how roosting addresses it. Both responses will directly answer the question by framing the explanation around "two ways roosting is important," using the lecture's examples without adding external information. I'll keep sentences concise and vary transitional phrases between versions while maintaining the 100-120 word range suitable for oral delivery.
