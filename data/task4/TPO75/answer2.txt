According to the lecture, roosting benefits bat survival through flight preparation and predator avoidance. One way is by facilitating flight: bats roost upside down in elevated spots because they can't take off from the ground. Letting go instantly puts them in the air to chase insects. Another way is providing safety from predators such as snakes and cats. When roosting high above the ground, these predators cannot access the bats, ensuring secure rest. In summary, these roosting strategies are vital for enabling feeding and minimizing threats, directly contributing to their survival.
