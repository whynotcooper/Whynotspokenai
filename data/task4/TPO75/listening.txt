Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class So let's continue the discussion on roosting that is the resting and sleeping behavior of winged animals today will talk about roosting behavior in bats, which roost in large groups, bats roost by hanging upside down with their feet above their heads from the roosts of caves from trees or from undersides of bridges their roosting behavior is actually quite important for their survival Well, bats like other animals need to eat to survive they feed on a variety of insects which they have to chase and catch in flight so they must be ready to fly however unlike birds, bats are not able to launch themselves into the air they can't take off from the ground but remember that they roost in high places, they use their front claws to climb to a high place like the roof of a cave to roost because they hang upside down from high locations, they can easily start to fly by simply releasing their grip, letting go of whatever they were clinging to then they're immediately in the air ready to chase catch and eat flying insects In addition, roosting provides a way for bats to hide from danger It protects them from predators when bats are resting or sleeping they can be easily attacked by predators like snakes and cats Can they defend themselves against these attacks while sleeping Well no this is where roosting helps by hanging upside down so far above the ground these predators, snakes and cats can't reach and attack them so the bats can rest and sleep safely.
