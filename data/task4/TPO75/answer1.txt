The professor explains that roosting is crucial for bats' survival in two key ways. First, it enables them to fly effectively. Since bats cannot launch from the ground, they roost upside down in high locations. By simply releasing their grip, they drop into flight, immediately ready to hunt insects. Second, roosting offers protection from predators. While sleeping, bats are vulnerable to animals like snakes and cats. However, by hanging high up in caves or under bridges, they place themselves out of reach, allowing them to rest safely. Thus, roosting supports both feeding and safety, which are essential for survival.
