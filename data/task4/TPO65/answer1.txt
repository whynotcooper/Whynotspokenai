The professor explains two strategies predators use to hunt animals that live in groups. The first method involves targeting an individual that stands out due to a distinctive feature. For instance, predator fish often chase minnows that are a different color from the rest of the school, as they are easier to see and focus on. The second strategy is to physically break up the group to isolate a single animal. Sharks exemplify this by swimming into large fish schools and thrashing their tails to scatter them. This separation allows the shark to easily pursue an individual fish that has become disconnected from the group.
