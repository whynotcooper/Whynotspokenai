I will first identify the lecture's main topic: strategies predators use to hunt animals that live in groups. The question specifically asks for "two ways," so I will extract the two key strategies mentioned: targeting distinctive individuals and physically separating groups. For each strategy, I will include the provided examples (minnows for the first, sharks for the second). My organization will follow a clear structure: state the main idea, describe the first strategy with its example, then describe the second strategy with its example. I will ensure both answers directly address the question, stay within 100–120 words, use cohesive devices, and avoid personal opinions. The two versions will vary in sentence structure and wording while maintaining accuracy.
