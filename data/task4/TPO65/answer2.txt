According to the lecture, predators employ two main techniques to overcome the challenge of hunting grouped animals. One approach is to single out an individual with a unique characteristic. A specific example given is how predator fish will hunt a minnow that has a different coloration, making it visually distinct and simpler to track. Another technique is to disrupt the group's cohesion. Sharks, for example, achieve this by forcefully thrashing their tails into a fish school, causing the group to scatter. Once the fish are separated, the shark can then focus on and capture an isolated individual more effectively.
