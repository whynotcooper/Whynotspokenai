According to the lecture, stores use product bundling in two key ways to sell more. One method is to prompt customers to buy additional products beyond their initial intention. This works because the bundle seems like a better financial value. The example given is a computer and printer sold together for less than their separate costs, which can convince someone just shopping for a computer to purchase both. Another way is to eliminate old inventory that isn't selling well. Stores bundle these less popular items with desirable ones to get them off the shelves. For example, bundling older computer games with new computers helps sell the games and free up space for new products.
