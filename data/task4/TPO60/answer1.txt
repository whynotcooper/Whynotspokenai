The professor explains two strategies stores employ with product bundling to increase sales. First, bundling encourages customers to purchase more items than they originally planned by creating a perception of greater value. For instance, a computer store might bundle a computer with a printer at a reduced price. A customer who only intended to buy a computer may choose the bundle, feeling they are getting a better deal. Second, bundling helps stores sell old, slow-moving inventory. By attaching these items to popular products, they can clear shelf space. The computer store could bundle outdated computer games with new computers, thereby selling the old games that customers wouldn't buy individually and making room for new stock.
