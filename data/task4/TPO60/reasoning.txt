I will first identify the main topic as "two ways stores use product bundling to sell more products," directly quoting the question's framing. The lecture clearly presents two strategies: 1) Encouraging customers to buy more than intended by creating perceived value, exemplified by the computer-printer bundle. 2) Clearing old inventory by bundling slow-selling items with popular ones, demonstrated through bundling outdated computer games with computers. My organization will follow: main topic statement → first strategy with example → second strategy with example. Both responses will strictly use lecture content without personal opinions, maintain 100-120 words for natural oral delivery, and employ varied cohesive devices and sentence structures between versions while ensuring direct task addressing.
