Number6In this question, you will listen to a short lecture you will then be asked to summarize important information from the lecture. After you hear the question you will have 20 seconds to prepare your response and 60 seconds to speak Listen to part of a lecture in a business class So stores use different strategies to get customers to buy more of their products and today we're going to talk about a strategy called product bundledling Bdling involves combining several products physically bundling them together so they're sold together and offering the entire set at a price less than customers would pay to buy all the items separately and stores use bundling to sell more products in a couple of different ways. one way that stores use bundling is to encourage customers to buy more products than they intended to when products are bundle together, customers will feel like they're getting more for their money so they're more likely to purchase the whole bundle even if they just plan to purchase one product So for example, let's say a computer store bundles a computer along with a printer and charges a lower price than people would pay to buy a computer and a printer separately. Well, even if customers were just looking for a computer they might be led to choose to buy the bundle because they think they're getting a good deal and getting a printer too Store also use bundling to help sell more of their old products that aren't selling well and make room for new ones. If a product has been sitting around for a long time they can bundle it along with another product to help sell it when people buy the whole bundle, the store is able to get the old product off the shelves. So let's go back to the computer store. they might have older computer games that people aren't really buying anymore. so they might try bundling the games with computers even though people aren't buying the games on their own since they are buying the computers, they might purchase the whole bundle this would help clear out the old games and make room for new ones. usingsing points and examples from the lecture, explain two ways stores use product bundling to sell more products.
