The professor explains that the expansion of the railroad system fundamentally altered business in the United States in two key ways. First, it allowed companies to sell their products nationwide. For instance, a clock company that was once limited to its local city could now use trains to distribute its merchandise across the entire country, vastly expanding its market. Second, railroads enabled the establishment of factories in new locations by transporting essential raw materials. The lecture gives the example of the southern United States, where a lack of local coal previously prevented industrial development. Once railroads were built, coal could be shipped in, allowing new factories to open and operate there.
