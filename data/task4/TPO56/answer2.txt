According to the lecture, the development of the railroads transformed American business through two major changes. One significant change was that businesses could now market their goods throughout the nation. The example given is a clock manufacturer that, after the railroad expansion, could load its products onto trains and sell them to consumers anywhere in the US. Another important change was that railroads made it feasible to build factories in areas lacking natural resources. For example, factories were opened in the South once railroads began delivering coal from other regions, providing the necessary power for machinery that wasn't previously available locally.
