I will first identify the main topic: how the railroad system changed US business. The question explicitly asks for "two ways," so I will extract the two key points from the lecture: 1) enabling nationwide sales of goods, and 2) facilitating factory openings in new locations by transporting raw materials. For each point, I will include the specific examples provided (the clock company and southern factories). My organization will follow a clear structure: state the main idea, then explain the first way with its example, followed by the second way with its example. I will ensure both answers directly address the question, stay within the word count, use appropriate transitions, and maintain an academic tone without personal commentary.
