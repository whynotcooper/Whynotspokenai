In my view, it is considerably more beneficial to invest time in careful deliberation before reaching a conclusion. The primary advantage is that it helps prevent serious and costly mistakes. A personal example is when I bought my laptop; by comparing specifications and reading numerous reviews over several days, I avoided a model with known hardware issues, which saved me a substantial amount of money and frustration. Furthermore, well-considered choices typically foster a stronger sense of confidence and fulfillment. For example, before deciding on my college major, I deeply reflected on my skills and future goals. This process ensured my decision was sound, and I remain pleased with it years later. Hence, taking one's time leads to more prudent and rewarding decisions.
