The topic asks whether quick, intuitive decision-making or slow, careful deliberation is better. I will argue that careful decision-making is superior. This stance is clear and supportable because it aligns with minimizing risks and achieving better long-term outcomes, which are universally valued. The response will be structured as follows: first, state the opinion that careful decision-making is better. Then, provide the first reason—it reduces costly mistakes—with a personal example about a major purchase. Finally, give the second reason—it leads to more confidence and satisfaction—with an example about choosing a university major.
