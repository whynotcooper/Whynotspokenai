Without a doubt, my preference is for texting over calling to obtain information. One significant advantage is its time-saving nature. A perfect example is when I need a quick answer from a friend, like a restaurant recommendation; a brief message exchange is far more expedient than a full phone conversation. Furthermore, having a tangible record of the information is a major benefit. If a family member texts me a shopping list, I have a permanent reference, eliminating the risk of forgetting items that can happen when details are only communicated verbally.
