I definitely prefer sending text messages when I need information. The primary reason is efficiency; texting is much faster for simple queries. For instance, if I need to confirm a meeting time with a colleague, I can send a quick text and get a reply without the formalities of a phone call, saving us both valuable time. Secondly, texting provides a written record. This is incredibly useful for details like addresses or instructions, as I can refer back to the message later instead of trying to remember a verbal conversation, which prevents potential errors.
