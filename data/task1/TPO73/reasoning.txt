The topic is about communication preferences for obtaining information: texting versus calling. I will take the stance that I prefer sending text messages. This is a clear and supportable position because it allows for a direct comparison of benefits like efficiency and convenience. The response will be structured as follows: first, state my opinion clearly. Then, provide the first reason (efficiency and time-saving) with a personal example. Finally, give the second reason (convenience of having a written record) with another relevant example. This structure ensures a logical flow from opinion to supported arguments.
