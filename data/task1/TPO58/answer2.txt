I would opt for the small apartment without hesitation. The most significant advantage is the undisturbed study environment it offers. Unlike a shared house where communal activities and noise are common, a private apartment ensures I can focus entirely on my coursework, such as preparing for important presentations. Additionally, living alone grants me complete autonomy over my living space. I can organize my routine and personal items without needing to accommodate others, fostering a sense of independence and well-being that supports both my academic performance and personal life.
