If I were choosing a place to live near my university, I would definitely select the small apartment. My primary reason is that it provides a quiet, private environment essential for effective studying. For instance, in a shared house, noise from roommates can easily disrupt concentration, whereas in my own apartment, I could study for exams without interruptions. Secondly, having my own space means greater personal freedom and comfort. I wouldn’t have to coordinate schedules or share belongings, allowing me to relax and manage my time according to my own preferences, which is vital for reducing stress during the academic year.
