The topic is about choosing between shared student housing or a private apartment near a university. I will choose the private apartment because it offers better focus and personal comfort, which are crucial for academic success. This stance is clear and supportable because privacy and a controlled environment are widely recognized as beneficial for studying. I will structure my response by stating my opinion first, then providing two reasons with examples: the first reason will focus on the advantage of having a quiet, distraction-free space for studying, and the second reason will highlight the benefit of personal freedom and comfort in one's own living space.
