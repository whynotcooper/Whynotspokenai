The topic asks whether the journey (process) is more important than the destination (end result). I will take the stance that the process is indeed more important. This position is clear and supportable because it emphasizes learning, growth, and intrinsic value, which are universally relatable. I will structure my response by first stating my opinion, then providing two reasons with examples: 1) The process fosters personal development and learning, using the example of learning a musical instrument. 2) The process builds stronger relationships and memories, using the example of planning a trip with friends.
