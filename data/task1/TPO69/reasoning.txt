The topic asks whether I prefer to take many photos or not at special gatherings with loved ones. I will take the stance of preferring to take photographs. This is a clear and supportable position because it allows me to discuss the tangible and emotional value of photos. My response structure will be: first, state my opinion clearly. Then, provide my first reason—that photos serve as a permanent, vivid record of joy—and support it with a personal example. Finally, give my second reason—that sharing these photos strengthens bonds over time—and illustrate this with another brief example.
