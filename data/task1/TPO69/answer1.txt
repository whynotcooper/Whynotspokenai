I definitely prefer to take a lot of photographs during special occasions with my family and friends. My primary reason is that these pictures become a permanent record of our happiness. For instance, looking at photos from my grandmother’s birthday last year instantly brings back the warmth and laughter of that day. Furthermore, sharing these photos afterwards helps maintain our connections. When I send a picture from a reunion to a cousin who couldn’t attend, it makes them feel included and strengthens our relationship, extending the joy of the event long after it's over.
