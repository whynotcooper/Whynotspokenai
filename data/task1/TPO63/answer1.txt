I agree that teachers should not be overly friendly with their students. Firstly, maintaining a professional distance is crucial for classroom management. If a teacher acts like a peer, students may not respect their authority, leading to disciplinary issues. For instance, a teacher who jokes excessively might struggle to quiet a noisy class during important instructions. Secondly, excessive familiarity can create perceptions of favoritism. A teacher who is very close to certain students might be accused of bias when awarding grades, even if they are genuinely fair. This undermines the learning environment's integrity.
