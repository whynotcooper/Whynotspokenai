The topic asks whether teachers should maintain a professional distance and avoid being too friendly with students. I will take the stance that I agree with the statement. This position is clear and supportable because it prioritizes maintaining classroom authority and ensuring fair treatment. My response structure will be: first, state my opinion clearly; second, provide my first reason (maintaining authority and discipline) with a classroom example; third, provide my second reason (ensuring impartiality and fairness) with a grading scenario example.
