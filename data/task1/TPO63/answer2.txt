In my view, educators should avoid becoming too familiar with their pupils. The primary reason is that a certain degree of formality is necessary to uphold respect and order in the classroom. When an instructor behaves more like a friend, students are less likely to take directives seriously, which can disrupt lessons. Furthermore, close personal relationships can compromise objectivity. For example, if a teacher socializes frequently with a particular student outside of class, others may question the fairness of their academic assessments, potentially breeding resentment and an unhealthy academic atmosphere.
