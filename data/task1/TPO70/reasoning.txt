The topic asks about children's preferences for playing outdoors versus indoors. I will take the stance that playing outdoors is more beneficial. This position is clear and supportable because it allows for strong, universal arguments related to physical health and social development. The response will be structured as follows: first, state the opinion that outdoor play is superior. Then, provide the first reason (physical health benefits) with a concrete example (running in a park). Finally, give the second reason (development of social skills) with a corresponding example (team games like soccer).
