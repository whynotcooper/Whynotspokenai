In my view, big city life is preferable to that in a small town. One significant advantage is the abundance of career prospects. A clear example is my cousin, who is a graphic designer; she moved to a major urban center and immediately secured a position at a leading firm, an opportunity simply unavailable where she grew up. Furthermore, the cultural vibrancy of a city—with its theaters, international cuisine, and various festivals—provides a dynamic lifestyle that fosters personal growth and a broader worldview, which is typically lacking in a more rural setting.
