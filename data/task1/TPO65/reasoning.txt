The topic requires stating a clear position on a given statement and supporting it with two reasons and examples. For this exercise, I will assume the statement is: "It is better to live in a small town than a big city." I will take the stance of *disagreeing*, arguing that big cities offer superior opportunities. This stance is clear and supportable because cities provide tangible benefits in career and culture. The response structure will be: 1) State opinion, 2) First reason (career opportunities) with a personal/concrete example, 3) Second reason (cultural/social amenities) with another example, ensuring a natural flow suitable for a 45-second speech.
