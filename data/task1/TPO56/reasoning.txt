The topic asks whether learning to draw or paint is important for children. I will take the stance of agreement, as this position is widely supportable with common knowledge about child development. My response structure will be: state a clear opinion → introduce first reason (development of fine motor skills) with a concrete example → introduce second reason (emotional expression and stress relief) with a relatable example. This creates a balanced, persuasive argument that fits the time constraint without needing specialized knowledge.
