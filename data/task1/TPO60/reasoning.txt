The topic is a university policy requiring all students to own a laptop. I will take the stance of agreeing with this policy. This position is clear and supportable because it aligns with modern educational needs. I will structure my response by first stating my opinion, then providing two reasons with examples. The first reason will focus on academic efficiency and access to digital resources, with an example about research and assignments. The second reason will address equity, ensuring all students have the same essential tool for learning, with an example about in-class activities and group projects.
