I strongly agree that universities should require all students to own a laptop. Firstly, laptops significantly enhance academic efficiency. For instance, students can instantly access online libraries, submit assignments digitally, and utilize educational software, which streamlines their workflow and saves valuable time. Secondly, this policy promotes fairness. If every student has the same essential tool, it eliminates disadvantages for those who might not otherwise have consistent access to a computer, ensuring equal participation in class activities and collaborative projects. This creates a more level playing field for academic success.
