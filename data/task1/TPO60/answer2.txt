In my view, it is highly beneficial for a university to mandate that every student possesses a personal laptop. One primary reason is the improvement in learning effectiveness. Students can immediately look up information, use specialized programs for their courses, and manage their coursework online, making their studies more productive. Furthermore, such a requirement fosters educational equity. It guarantees that all learners have identical access to the fundamental technology needed for tasks like in-class exercises and team-based work, thereby preventing any academic disadvantage and supporting uniform opportunities for achievement.
