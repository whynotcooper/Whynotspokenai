I firmly believe modern technology simplifies our lives significantly. Firstly, it enhances efficiency by automating routine tasks. For instance, communication is now instantaneous through messaging apps and email, eliminating the delays of traditional mail and allowing for quick coordination in both personal and professional settings. Secondly, it provides unparalleled access to information. A student, for example, can now learn complex subjects through online courses and digital libraries at their convenience, bypassing the need to physically travel to educational institutions. This convenience saves considerable time and effort.
