The topic asks whether modern technology simplifies or complicates life. I will argue that it simplifies life, as this stance is clear and easily supported with common experiences. The response will be structured as: a clear opinion statement, followed by two distinct reasons, each with a concrete example. The first reason will focus on efficiency in daily tasks, using communication as an example. The second will address access to information, using online learning as an example. This structure ensures a logical flow from opinion to support.
