In my view, modern technology undoubtedly makes life easier rather than more complex. One major reason is the increased convenience in everyday activities. Consider how digital tools like smartphones allow us to manage schedules, pay bills, and communicate globally from one device, streamlining tasks that once required multiple steps. Additionally, technology democratizes knowledge acquisition. For example, anyone with an internet connection can instantly research any topic or acquire new skills through tutorials, removing previous barriers to education and self-improvement. This accessibility fundamentally simplifies achieving personal and professional goals.
