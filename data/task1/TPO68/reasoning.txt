The topic is a mandatory retirement age of 65. I will take the stance of disagreeing with this statement. This position is clear and supportable because it allows for arguments based on individual capability and economic contribution. The response will be structured as follows: first, state the opinion (disagreement). Then, provide the first reason that people's capabilities vary greatly, supported by an example of a productive professional over 65. The second reason will focus on the economic and social benefits of experienced workers, using an example of a mentor in a company. This structure ensures a logical flow from opinion to supported arguments.
