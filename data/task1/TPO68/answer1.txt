I strongly disagree that all workers should be forced to retire at 65. Firstly, people age at different rates; many individuals over 65 are perfectly capable and productive. For instance, a renowned surgeon at 68 might still perform complex operations with exceptional skill, a contribution that would be lost with a blanket retirement rule. Secondly, experienced employees provide invaluable mentorship and institutional knowledge. A senior engineer, for example, could guide younger colleagues, ensuring a smooth transfer of skills that benefits the entire organization. Therefore, mandatory retirement wastes valuable human resources.
