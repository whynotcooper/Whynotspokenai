I do not support a compulsory retirement age of 65 for every worker. My first reason is that individual health and mental sharpness differ significantly. Consider a university professor who, at age 70, continues to lead groundbreaking research and inspire students; forcing such a person to retire would be a detriment to their field. Furthermore, retaining seasoned workers is economically and socially advantageous. They offer wisdom and stability; for example, a senior manager's deep understanding of company history can help navigate complex challenges, making them an indispensable asset. A fixed retirement age ignores these critical benefits.
