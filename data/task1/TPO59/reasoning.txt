The topic asks whether it's better for students to prepare for high-opportunity careers or study subjects purely based on interest. I will argue that pursuing a field of genuine interest is superior. This stance is clear and supportable because it aligns with long-term success and well-being, which are universally valued. I will structure my response with a clear opinion statement, followed by two reasons with examples: first, that intrinsic motivation leads to greater persistence and mastery; second, that personal fulfillment from doing meaningful work outweighs mere financial security.
