I firmly believe that selecting a field of study based on personal interest is a wiser long-term strategy than merely chasing abundant job openings. The primary reason is that genuine enthusiasm fosters deep engagement and resilience. For example, a student passionate about environmental science will likely persevere through challenging coursework and innovate in their field, whereas someone in a lucrative but uninteresting major may lack the drive to excel. Furthermore, true professional happiness comes from alignment between one's work and personal values. A career in a high-opportunity sector like finance might provide material comfort, but it cannot guarantee the profound satisfaction derived from a vocation one is truly devoted to, such as social work or music. Therefore, personal fulfillment should be the paramount consideration.
