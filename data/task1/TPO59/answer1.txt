In my view, it is more advantageous for students to study subjects they are genuinely passionate about, even if the job market appears less promising. Firstly, profound personal interest fuels motivation and perseverance. A student fascinated by history, for instance, will likely devote immense effort to research and writing, developing exceptional analytical skills that are valuable in many professions, not just academia. Secondly, long-term career satisfaction stems from doing work one finds meaningful. While a high-demand tech job might offer security, a person who finds it monotonous may experience burnout, whereas someone working in a beloved field, like art conservation, gains daily fulfillment that transcends salary. Ultimately, passion is a sustainable driver for success.
