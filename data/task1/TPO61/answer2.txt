Without a doubt, I would opt for the older, compact residence near my workplace. The foremost advantage is the drastic reduction in daily travel time. For example, a short walk to the office would free up numerous hours each week, which I could dedicate to professional development, hobbies, or simply getting adequate rest, leading to a much healthier work-life balance. Furthermore, such proximity fosters a stronger connection to my local environment. I could conveniently meet colleagues for impromptu coffee, easily run errands during lunch breaks, and feel more a part of the neighborhood's social fabric, benefits that a distant, modern house simply cannot provide.
