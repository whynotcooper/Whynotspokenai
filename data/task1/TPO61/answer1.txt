I would unquestionably choose the small, old apartment close to my university. My primary reason is the significant amount of time and stress I would save by eliminating a long daily commute. For instance, instead of spending hours in traffic or on public transport, I could use that time for studying, exercising, or relaxing, which would greatly improve my academic performance and personal well-being. Secondly, living within a five-minute walk would allow me to be more integrated into the campus community. I could easily participate in last-minute study groups, attend campus events, and build stronger relationships with my peers, enriching my overall university experience far more than a spacious home ever could.
