The topic requires choosing between a large, new home far from work/university and a small, old home very close to it. I will argue for the small, old home nearby. This stance is clear because it prioritizes practical daily benefits over material comfort. I'll structure my response by first stating my preference, then giving two reasons with examples: (1) the immense time savings and reduced stress from a short commute, and (2) the greater opportunity for community integration and spontaneous social interaction that a central location affords.
