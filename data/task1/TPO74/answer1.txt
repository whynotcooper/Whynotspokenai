I agree that teenagers often cause significant problems for their parents. Firstly, the natural desire for independence frequently leads to conflicts over household rules. For instance, arguments about curfews, screen time, or chores are commonplace, creating daily tension and requiring constant negotiation. Secondly, the academic and social pressures of adolescence are a major source of parental worry. When a teenager struggles with schoolwork or faces issues with friends, parents inevitably share this stress, spending considerable time and emotional energy providing support and seeking solutions to these complex problems.
