The topic asks whether teenagers cause many problems for their parents. I will take the stance that I agree with this statement. This position is clear and supportable because adolescence is a period of significant physical, emotional, and social development, which naturally leads to conflicts and challenges within the family unit. My response will be structured as follows: first, I will state my opinion clearly. Then, I will provide my first reason, which is the struggle for independence leading to conflicts over rules and curfews, supported by a common example. My second reason will focus on the academic and social pressures teenagers face, which can cause stress and worry for parents, again illustrated with a typical scenario.
