Yes, I firmly believe that teenagers can be a source of numerous difficulties for their parents. One primary reason is their push for autonomy, which results in repeated disputes over boundaries, such as negotiating later nights out or increased privacy, inevitably causing friction at home. Furthermore, the challenges associated with their education and peer relationships generate considerable anxiety for parents. For example, if a teen is performing poorly in a key subject or experiencing social exclusion, their parents bear the burden of this concern, often investing immense effort in guiding them through these turbulent years.
