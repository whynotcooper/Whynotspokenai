I strongly agree that friends should maintain their friendship despite disagreements. First, differing opinions are inevitable in any meaningful relationship. For instance, my closest friend and I have completely opposite political views, but we respect each other's perspectives and our bond remains strong. Second, working through disagreements actually deepens friendships by fostering mutual understanding. When my friend questioned my career change, our discussion helped me see new angles and ultimately strengthened our trust. These experiences prove that friendship isn't about perfect agreement but about respecting differences.
