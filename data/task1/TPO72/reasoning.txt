The topic asks whether friends should be able to disagree and remain friends. I will take the stance of strong agreement, as this is a clear, supportable position that aligns with the realities of mature relationships. My response structure will be: state my opinion clearly, then provide two distinct reasons with concrete examples. First, I will argue that disagreement is natural and unavoidable, using differing political views as an example. Second, I will explain how respectful disagreement strengthens bonds through mutual growth, using a personal example about career choices. This creates a balanced argument covering both the inevitability and benefits of disagreement in friendship.
