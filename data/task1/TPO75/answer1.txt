I firmly believe that it is easier to be a student than a teacher. Firstly, teachers carry the immense responsibility of educating an entire class. For instance, if a student fails to grasp a concept, the teacher is accountable for finding alternative ways to explain it, which is a significant pressure students don't face. Secondly, a teacher's work extends far beyond the classroom. They must spend countless hours preparing lessons and grading assignments, whereas a student's primary duty is their own learning, which is a more manageable and self-focused task.
