The topic asks whether it is easier to be a teacher or a student. I will take the stance that it is easier to be a student. This position is clear and supportable because the responsibilities and pressures on teachers are generally greater. I will structure my response by first stating my opinion, then providing two reasons with examples. The first reason will focus on the burden of responsibility for others' learning, and the second will address the extensive preparation and grading work required outside of class hours.
