In my view, being a student is undoubtedly less difficult than being an educator. One major reason is the difference in accountability. A teacher is responsible for the academic progress of all their pupils, a heavy burden. For example, if several children are struggling, the instructor must dedicate extra time to help them, a pressure learners do not experience. Furthermore, educators have substantial workloads outside of teaching hours, such as planning curricula and assessing papers, while a scholar's main obligation is to their own studies, a far more contained and personal responsibility.
