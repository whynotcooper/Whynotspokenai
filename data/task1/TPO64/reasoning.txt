The topic asks for a preference between getting information from books versus using a computer/the internet. I will take the stance of preferring computers/internet for information access. This is a clear and supportable position because it allows me to discuss modern advantages like speed and breadth of information, which are universally relatable. I will structure both responses identically for clarity: first stating my opinion, then providing two main reasons with concrete examples. The first reason will focus on the superior speed and immediacy of online information, and the second reason will highlight the vast, multi-format breadth of available content. Both answers will use different vocabulary and sentence structures while conveying the same core argument.
