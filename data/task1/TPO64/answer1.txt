I definitely prefer using a computer to access information online. My primary reason is the sheer speed and convenience. For instance, if I need to check a fact for a project, I can get an answer from a search engine in seconds, whereas finding the same detail in a book would require visiting a library and searching through an index. Secondly, the internet offers an unparalleled breadth of resources. I can read articles, watch instructional videos, and look at infographics on the same topic, which provides a much more comprehensive and engaging understanding than a single text could offer.
