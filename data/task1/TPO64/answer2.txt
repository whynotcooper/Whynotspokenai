Without a doubt, I favor obtaining information through a computer connected to the internet. The first major advantage is immediacy; digital information is available instantly. A perfect example is researching current events; news websites are updated by the minute, while books on the same subject are inevitably outdated by the time they are published. Furthermore, the diversity of content online is exceptional. Instead of being limited to text, I can access academic journals, interactive data visualizations, and expert podcasts, creating a richer and more dynamic learning experience.
