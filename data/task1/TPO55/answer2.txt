I am definitely in favor of leaving my free time unscheduled rather than planning it out meticulously. One significant advantage is the freedom to be spontaneous. A perfect example is when an unexpected opportunity arises, like a last-minute movie outing with colleagues; I can take part without any conflict. Furthermore, keeping my schedule open is crucial for achieving real relaxation. Without the pressure of a pre-arranged activity, I can simply decompress, perhaps by reading or taking a nap, which effectively restores my energy after a busy period.
