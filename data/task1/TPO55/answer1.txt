Personally, I strongly prefer to keep my free time open rather than scheduling it in advance. My first reason is that this approach allows for spontaneity. For instance, if a friend spontaneously invites me to a concert or a hike, I am free to join them without being tied to a prior plan. This often leads to the most memorable and enjoyable experiences. Secondly, an unscheduled block of time provides genuine mental rest. After a demanding week of structured work and classes, having no obligations allows my mind to truly unwind and recharge, which is essential for my well-being.
