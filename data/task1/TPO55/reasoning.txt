The topic asks whether I prefer to plan free time in advance or keep it open. I will take the stance that I prefer to keep my free time open and unscheduled. This is a clear and supportable position because it allows me to highlight the benefits of spontaneity and relaxation, which are universally relatable. I will structure my response by first stating my opinion, then providing two reasons with examples: the first reason will focus on the value of spontaneity and seizing unexpected opportunities, and the second will emphasize the importance of using free time for genuine rest and mental recovery without the pressure of a schedule.
