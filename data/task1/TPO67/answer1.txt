I firmly believe that staying with a host family is the superior option for students studying abroad. Firstly, it offers an unparalleled opportunity for deep cultural immersion. Instead of just observing the culture from a distance, a student becomes part of a local family's daily life, participating in their traditions and meals. For example, they might celebrate a local holiday with the family, gaining insights a tourist or independent student would never access. Secondly, it provides a constant, real-world environment for language practice. A student is compelled to use the language for everyday conversations, like discussing their day at dinner, which rapidly accelerates fluency far more than a classroom ever could.
