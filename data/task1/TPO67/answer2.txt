In my view, residing with a host family is significantly more beneficial for international students. One major advantage is the authentic cultural integration it facilitates. A student doesn't just learn about the culture academically; they experience it firsthand by sharing a home, which might involve learning to cook local dishes or understanding social customs directly. Furthermore, this living arrangement creates an ideal setting for linguistic development. Being surrounded by native speakers forces a student to practice the language continuously in a natural context, such as asking for help with chores, thereby improving their communication skills effectively and organically.
