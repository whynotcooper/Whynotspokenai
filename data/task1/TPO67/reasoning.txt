The topic asks students studying abroad to choose between living independently (alone or with friends) or with a host family. I will argue that staying with a host family is better. This stance is clear and supportable because it directly enhances the core study-abroad goals of cultural immersion and language practice. My response structure will be: 1) State my opinion. 2) Provide the first reason (cultural immersion) with a concrete example. 3) Provide the second reason (language practice) with another example. This creates a logical, easy-to-follow argument within the time limit.
