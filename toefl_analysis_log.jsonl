You will then be asked to summarize important information from the lecture. After you hear the question, you will have 20 seconds to prepare your response and 60 seconds to speak. Listen to part of a talk in a biology class. Today, I'd like to talk about two of the various theories that scientists have advanced to explain the extinction of dinosaurs. In the first theory, the extinction is associated with a lack of food In the second theory, it's an increase in the earth's temperature that is considered the reason why dinosaurs died out. the lack of food theory goes like this. and asteroid, a giant space rock crashed into the earth throwing a huge amount of dust into the atmosphere. This dust cloud blocked the sun's ray. Now, the lack of sunlight was a big problem because as you know, plants need sunlight to make their food. but after the asteroids impact, no sunlight could reach plants. So many of them died. and this caused animals that ate plants to die. and animals that ate the animals that ate plants. you're with me they all died off. So our dinosaurs, whether they ate plants or meat became extinct. Now, As for the other theory, Call it a global warming theory. Well, some scientists believed that a series of large volcanic eruptions filled the air with carbon monoxide. While the carbon monoxide let the sun's radiation enter the atmosphere. it did not let it out which meant that heat was trapped. This caused a significant rise in the earth's temperature. Now, it so happens that among reptiles like our dinosaurs, the gender of the young depends upon the temperature of the eggs. Warer temperatures make for warmer eggs and warmer eggs result in more males than females being born. supposedly, this is what happened to the dinosaurs. because of the warm temperatures. fewer females were born. which meant that fewer eggs were being produced, and eventually this led to the dinosaurs extinction. usinging the points from the talk, De the two theories that explain the extinction of the dinosaur.", "question": "Use the example described by the professor to explain what role distancing is.", "student_answer": "there are two theories about the distinction of dinosaur the first is lack of food it explains that a planet crash earth and block sun and without sunlight plant without sunlight so they have a live  and the animal who a plant die and the animal a other animal also die so this the first reason the next reason that the global warmer which have more carbon  dioxide make the heat can out the heat was trapped ped and the gender growing slow and the warmer temperature the female are fewer, so dinaousor distincted", "feedback": {"issues": ["The student misinterprets the second theory by stating 'carbon dioxide' instead of 'carbon monoxide' and incorrectly describes the mechanism as 'heat can out' when the lecture explains heat was trapped.

You will then be asked to summarize important information from the lecture. After you hear the question you will have 20 seconds to prepare your response and 60 seconds to speak. Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class. All animals need to be able to survive in a particular habitat. Some animal species rely on their speed for survival. Being able to run or fly quickly helps them to hunt to capture prey and it also helps them to escape from danger. Why are these animals so fast. Well, these animals have developed physical adaptations that help them to run at high speeds. Let's discuss a couple of these adaptations. Some animals have specially adapted feet that allow them to travel fast over rough ground. extremely fast animals may have feet that are very tough on the bottom. This helps them escape from a predator or capture prey more efficiently since they can run after them at high speeds over rough ground without hurting their feet. For example, the cheetah. These large cats are among the fastest animals in the world and many of them live in the African desert for the ground is rough and also gets very hot. So cheetah have feet with tough pads on the bottom. These pads protect them from the hot sand and sticks and stones so they don't hurt their feet and have to slow down. Another adaptation that allows animals to run at high speeds is especially adapted legs. animals that have long powerful legs are generally able to run faster than other animals, looking again at the cheetah, the cheetah has very muscular back legs when a cheetah starts to run, it pushes off on one of its powerful back legs, sending the body forward in a matter of seconds. What's more the cheetah's legs are very long, allowing them to take huge steps covering a greater distance in less time than if they had shorter legs.

Second, the lecture describes specially adapted legs. Cheetahs possess long, powerful, and muscular back legs.

This false belief, that others\n can “see through us” and know even our innermost feelings that we try to hide, is\n called the illusion of transparency. Why are we susceptible to such an illusion? Why\n do wesometimes believe that our feelings are more obvious to others than they\n really are? Research suggests that the reason is this: when our emotions are very\n strong, we focus on them very intently and are extremely aware of them. This\n heightened awareness of our own feelings causes us to assume that they must be\n obvious to others as well.", "listening_passage": "Now, listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class. Now, before we get into some of the research in this area, let me tell you about something that just happened to me that that's a good example of this. the other night I was invited to a dinner party at a friend's house. Now you should know that this friend Mary, she's a really great cook. and I was really looking forward to this dinner. So that night, everything was going great until she served the main dish. I could tell from the smell that shed used a certain spice that I really dislike. it's garlic. I can't stand even the smell of it. and it was clear that this dish had a lot of garlic in it. Now, of course, I didn't want to offend my friend. I didn't want her to know I didn't like the food. so I tried to behave normally and eat as much as I could. but I was sure she could tell I wasn't enjoying it. Well, later, I was walking home with another friend Mike, he'd also been at the dinner. I started telling him how worried I was that I had offended Mary. I told him you know about how I really hated garlic and how I was sure that Mary had noticed that I didn't like the meal that I was sure I had insulted our host. Well, he was really surprised. he hadn't notice that at all. In fact, he thought I seemed to be enjoying the meal. that made me feel a little better. but anyway, the next day I called Mary to thank her for inviting me to the dinner. she was really pleased and talked about how nice the party was and how glad she was that everyone had liked the food so much. It was pretty clear from our conversation that she hadn't noticed anything. I guess my feelings hadn't been as obvious to Mary word to Mike as I thought they were.Explain how the professor's experience at the dinner party illustrates the illusion of transparency..😊", "question": "Explain how the professors experience at the dinner party illustrates the illusion of\n transparency", "student_answer": "illusion of transparency is that we force believe that other people will detect our emotion when our emotion are strong  one for example one night the professor went to his friends mary party and taste her food he is looking forward the mar's food but when he ta smells spice  garlic he didn't like the garlic but he try to behave normally and he is worrying about that he action will be notice by the Mary and offend  the Mary but mike said that he was surprised and he think the professor is enjoying the meal and the Mary didn't notice it", "feedback": {"issues": ["The student's response fails to explicitly connect the professor's experience to the key psychological mechanism described in the reading. The reading explains the illusion occurs because strong emotions cause heightened self-awareness, leading us to assume they are obvious to others. The student mentions the professor's strong dislike of garlic and worry, but does not state that this intense focus on his own feelings made him believe they were transparent.", "The response omits a crucial detail from the lecture that directly supports the reading's explanation. The student mentions Mike's surprise and Mary's lack of notice, but does not include the professor's own realization stated at the end of the lecture: 'I guess my feelings hadn't been as obvious... as I thought they were.' This is the direct illustration of the illusion.", "The organization is somewhat unclear and the language contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that affect clarity (e.g., 'we force believe,' 'he is looking forward the mar's food,' 'he action will be notice'). While the core sequence of events is present, the explanation of the relationship between the lecture example and the reading concept is not effectively structured or articulated."], "reason": "Content: The student identifies the basic premise of the illusion (believing others detect our emotions) and recounts the main events of the professor's story. However, the response is incomplete. It misses the explicit link from the reading about *why* the illusion happens (heightened self-awareness) and omits the professor's concluding reflection, which is the key evidence that his belief was an 'illusion.' Integration: The response does not successfully explain *how* the story illustrates the concept. It lists events but does not clearly articulate that the professor's intense focus on his own dislike and worry (the mechanism from the reading) led him to incorrectly believe his feelings were obvious (the illusion), which was proven false by his friends' reactions. The relationship is implied but not stated. Task Fulfillment: The response attempts to answer the prompt but does not fully fulfill it because it does not provide a complete explanation of the illustration. It stays on topic and does not offer personal opinion. Coherence: The sequence of events is roughly correct, but the explanation lacks a clear introductory statement defining the concept and a concluding statement summarizing the illustration. The flow is choppy due to grammatical issues. Language Use: Numerous grammatical errors ('force believe,' incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, 'he action') and unclear phrasing hinder the clarity and precision required for a high score.", "answer": "The reading passage defines the illusion of transparency as the false belief that our internal emotions are obvious to others, especially when we try to hide them. It explains this happens because strong emotions make us hyper-aware of our own feelings, leading us to assume they are equally visible externally. The professor's experience perfectly illustrates this. He strongly disliked the garlic in his friend's meal and was intensely focused on hiding his reaction. This heightened self-awareness, as the reading describes, caused him to believe his dislike was transparent to his host, Mary. He was convinced he had offended her. However, the lecture reveals that neither his friend Mike nor Mary had noticed his discomfort. Mike was surprised by the professor's worry, and Mary later expressed pleasure that everyone enjoyed the food. This outcome directly demonstrates the 'illusion'—his feelings were not at all obvious to others, contradicting his own assumption.", "phrases": ["The reading passage introduces the concept of...", "This concept is illustrated by the professor's personal anecdote about...", "The professor's experience serves as a concrete example of...", "This outcome directly demonstrates how...", "Thus, the lecture provides a clear real-world illustration of the reading's theory."], "sentences": ["The reading passage introduces the concept of the illusion of transparency.", "This concept is illustrated by the professor's personal anecdote about a dinner party where he disliked the food.", "The professor's experience serves as a concrete example of how intense personal focus on an emotion can create a false belief in its visibility.", "This outcome directly demonstrates how the individual's internal assumption was incorrect, as his friends perceived no such discomfort.", "Thus, the lecture provides a clear real-world illustration of the reading's theory that strong emotions can lead us to overestimate how apparent they are to others."]}}
