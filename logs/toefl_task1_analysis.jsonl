It mentions talking with people and work needs but doesn't elaborate on why these matter. The single example about a friend in marketing is underdeveloped and doesn't fully support the argument. Vocabulary is simple and repetitive ('know,' 'things'). While coherent, it fails to meet the depth expected for a high score, with insufficient explanation of benefits like adaptability, innovation, or problem-solving that come from broad knowledge.", "answer": "I strongly agree that having broad knowledge across many subjects is more valuable than deep specialization. First, interdisciplinary thinking drives innovation; for instance, Steve Jobs combined calligraphy with technology to create Apple's beautiful typography. Second, broad knowledge enhances adaptability in today's rapidly changing job market, where roles often require skills from multiple domains. Finally, it fosters better decision-making and communication, as understanding diverse perspectives helps in collaborating effectively. While specialization has its place, a well-rounded education prepares individuals for complex, real-world challenges more comprehensively.", "phrases": ["interdisciplinary thinking", "drives innovation", "enhances adaptability", "fosters better decision-making", "well-rounded education"], "sentences": ["Interdisciplinary thinking allows connections between seemingly unrelated fields.", "Collaboration between biology and engineering drives innovation in medical devices.", "Learning multiple skills enhances adaptability in unpredictable job markets.", "Exposure to diverse viewpoints fosters better decision-making in leadership roles.", "A well-rounded education provides the foundation for lifelong learning and success."]}}
