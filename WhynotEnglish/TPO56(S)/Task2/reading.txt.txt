Students Need Campus Snack Shop
I think the university should open a snack shop on campus-a snack shop that wouldbe operated entirely by our students. A student- run snack shop would benefitstudents in two ways. First, it would create a number of job opportunities forstudents Second, the store would be a convenient place on campus to buy food,providing students with a fast； easy place to get snacks at any time of the day
